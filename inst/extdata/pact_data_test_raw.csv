The study will aim to measure the age-specific seroprevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at 3 time points, each 6 months apart. Age-specific incidence estimates will be applied to the census population to obtain numbers of infections in the population at each time point. These estimates will be compared with external data on COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in each setting, to calculate age-specific infection-hospitalisation and infection-fatality ratios. SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics will be defined by studying changes in antibody titres over time. Risk factors for infection will be studied by comparing SARS-CoV-2 seroconverters and non-seroconverters with respect to epidemiological exposures. This study will provide crucial information regarding population exposure and SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, and will provide a complete picture of the relationship between clinically apparent and asymptomatic infections.","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,424206003,NA,-99,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4280.e","National University of Singapore","Singapore","702",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand","702, 344, 764",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3","3a, 3b","","",2

Building on existing infrastructures and collaborations we will create a network to share knowledge on next generation sequencing (NGS), including Oxford Nanopore Technology (MinION), coronavirus biology and COVID-19 disease control. Our consortium links three African sites combined with genomics and informatics support from the University of Glasgow to achieve the following key goals: 1. Support East and West African capacities for rapid diagnosis and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to help with contact tracing and quarantine measures. Novel diagnostic tools optimized for this virus will be deployed. An African COVID-19 case definition will be refined using machine learning for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections. 2. Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 will be performed in one cohort at each African site. This will use established cohorts to ensure that sampling begins quickly.

To date 9 countries in Africa have recorded infection and it seems imminent that East Africa will have introductions and onward transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 virus (the aetiological agent of COVID-19) spreads rapidly (R0~2, serial interval about 1 week), and hence control will be difficult.  National plans for dealing with this public health emergency will benefit from predictions of the expected rate, distribution and extent of spread in countries throughout the region, and on the likely impact and feasibility of isolation and contact tracing interventions. We will support the emergency preparations through bespoke modelling, incorporating known demographic population structure, age-related contact patterns and existing mobile phone population movement data. In Uganda and Kenya we will collect epidemiological, genomic and behavioural data through health facility surveillance, household follow-up and contact studies to quantify uncertainties of SARS-CoV-2  virus epidemiology and contact patterns in well and unwell individuals. Results from the study will be rapidly communicated to the relevant authorities, and modelling code and analysis, and data including sequences, placed in the public domain in near real-time.

There are limited data, across Europe, Asia and Africa, on the prevalence of infection and seroconversion against widely circulating and mildly symptomatic HCoVs (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1). There is a current supposition that antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) may play a role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. ADE occurs when non-neutralizing antiviral proteins facilitate virus entry into host cells, leading to increased infectivity in the cells. In such cases, higher viremia has been measured and the clinical course of disease can be more severe. In preclinical animal models, immunopathology was observed after challenge following vaccination with some SARS vaccines. Therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the impact of immunopathology and ADE on prophylactic vaccination against SARS and possibly SARS-CoV-2. Goals: to perform detailed systems serology of pre-existing immunity, in children and adults, from the UK and Africa, towards novel and commonly circulating coronaviruses. Impact: These studies highlight the limited knowledge in the field and a need for a systematic approach to investigate cross-reactive humoral immunity against HCoV to  inform the immunopathology and pathophysiology of COVID-19.","",-77,1,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,43489008,NA,NA,NA,-99,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4991.5","University of Oxford","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1","1d","","",2

Almost 100% of patients showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in their lungs by chest CT scans indicating acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism(s) of ALI induced by SARS-CoV-2 is very important to inform vaccine safety and immunotherapeutic strategies. In this proposal, we will investigate the host immune responses and their association with severity of ALI in patient samples and animal models. We will bring together a team of experts with complementary expertise including immunopathology in coronavirus infections, up-to-date lab technologies, and know-how to ensure the feasibility of this study with the following goals: 1)    defining SARS-CoV-2 specific serum profiles (epitopes) using yeast display antigen library 2)    determining antibody functions including antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) vs neutralizing activities in vitro assays 3)    studying T cell (CD4 and CD8) responses to whole SARS-CoV-2 genome 4)    evaluating ALI in response to live SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without passive immunity (antibody or T cells) generated from vaccine candidates in a humanized mice model.","",-77,1,2020,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-99,NA,-9999,NA,-88,NA,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.7445.2","Imperial College","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1","1d","","",2

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    ChAdOx1 is a replication-deficient simian adenoviral vector that provides a platform technology for the production of vaccines against many infectious diseases. For Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, a single dose of the ChAdOx1-vectored MERS vaccine resulted in protection against MERS challenge in non-human primates and the induction of strong humoral and T cell responses in a Phase I clinical trial. The same vaccine design has now been followed to produce ChAdOx1 nCoV. Preclinical studies of the vaccine will be initiated by the end of February. This will include demonstration of vaccine immunogenicity (antibody and T cell) in mice, followed by vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy against nCoV-19 challenge in ferrets and non-human primates with collaborators at PHE Porton Down and NIH. A pre-GMP vaccine seed stock is in production at Oxford??????s GMP manufacturing facility, and will be provided to Advent, Italy, which will produce the first 1000 doses for clinical studies. In parallel with preclinical studies and vaccine manufacturing, Oxford will work with the MHRA on a rapid release testing package. This will employ deep sequencing of the Cell Harvest and Drug Substance to identify any potential replication competent adenovirus and adventitious agents rather than following the existing set of in vivo and in vitro assays, greatly reducing the time to cGMP certification. A phase I/II clinical trial will then be undertaken to demonstrate vaccine safety and immunogenicity in adults, older adults and children.","ChAdOx1 is a safe and effective vaccine vector that can be used to produce vaccines  against many different diseases. Unlike other rapid vaccine technologies, only a single  dose of the vaccine is likely to be needed. DNA, mRNA and recombinant protein vaccines  typically require two or three doses to achieve protective immunity. ChAdOx1 has been  used to make a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus vaccine which is  protective in non-human primates after a single dose, and is safe and highly immunogenic  in humans as demonstrated in a phase I clinical trial. The same vaccine design has been  followed to produce ChAdOx1 nCoV. We now propose to manufacture this vaccine to  cGMP and conduct a clinical trial in healthy volunteers in the UK. We will work closely with  the MHRA to complete all required testing of the vaccine and obtain regulatory approval in  as short a time as possible, with the aim of initiaiting the clinical trial in June.  We will also work with partners to demonstrate protective efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV in  two different animal models. This will provide the necessary information to support further  clinical trials of this vaccine to demonstrate efficacy in humans.",-77,-77,2020,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,-9999,NA,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4991.5","University of Oxford","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom, Italy","826, 380",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"7","7a","","",0

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    Medicines to prevent and effectively treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), especially severe lower respiratory tract (LRT) illness, would save lives and reduce healthcare pressures. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are ongoing in China of lopinavir/ritonavir [ChiCTR2000029308] and remdesivir [NCT04257656 and NCT04252664]. Additional potential therapeutics are being considered by the WHO. Building on our existing experience and capabilities, we are proposing to implement a multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) RCT. This trial will be designed to evaluate up to four experimental therapeutics in a flexible, adaptive framework. MAMS designs have been shown to be more efficient than sequential RCTs or factorial designs.  The trial will enrol patients hospitalised with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Patients will initially be randomised equally to receive one of up to 4 active treatments or control. Should not all active arms be available at study onset, patients will be randomized between available active arms and control. The trial will commence with two active arms, lopinavir/ritonavir and low dose dexamethasone. Additional active arms will be added as data and drug availability allow.","The coronavirus epidemic is a global health emergency. The infection can, in a minority of cases, cause serious lung disease requiring hospital-care and even death. Whilst general hospital care can improve patients? recovery, there are currently no specific medicines for this infection. The best way to prove that medicines are effective and safe is through clinical trials which compare the new medicine against normal care.     Clinical trials of two of the most promising medicines have already enrolled patients in China. There are, however, many other medicines that have been proposed for the treatment of patients with the novel coronavirus.     We will start a new trial in the UK to test up to four additional medicines. Patients hospitalised with confirmed coronavirus infection will be invited to join the trial and we will assess whether the new medicines are safe and can improve patients? recovery.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China has reached pandemic status and causes a disease termed COVID-19. Therapeutics and vaccines are urgently needed. The normal pace of new drug development is incompatible with strategies to rapidly combat COVID-19. Drug combinations with antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity will likely be essential to treat infected patients, as acute respiratory virus-induced disease is commonly mediated by inflammatory responses to infection.  An alternative strategy to rapidly identify therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 is drug repurposing. As the drugs are already FDA-approved, it is cost-effective and time-efficient. To this end, we will exploit MuSIC (multiplex screening of interacting compounds) screening of a unique library consisting of ~1,000 drugs to identify single and synergistic interacting compounds that have either SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity or anti-inflammatory activities, with limited/no toxicities. This library includes FDA-approved compounds and antiviral drugs that showed activity against other cornoviruses (SARS-CoV & MERS-CoV) (1). Drug candidates will be validated using SARS-CoV-2-infection of well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cell cultures (WD-PAECs), which are excellent surrogates of human airway epithelium. WD-PAECs represent the most relevant pre-clinical translational model for screening therapeutic drugs for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses that same receptor/entry factors as SARS-CoV (2), which infects WD-PAEC cultures. Our findings will identify candidate drugs for treating COVID-19 patients, which can quickly enter clinical trials or be employed for compassionate use, especially in the case of viral diseases lacking specific treatments.  (1): Mani et al. J Young Pharm, 2019; 11(2) : 117-121  (2): Hoffmann et al. bioRxiv https:","SARS/CoV-2 was recently identified as the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Current efforts are focused on containment and separation of infected individuals, with no registered drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, drugs that have been registered for the treatment of other coronavirus conditions might be used (off-label) in an attempt to save the lives of COVID-19 patients. As development of vaccines and drugs for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been brought to priority status by WHO and governments, numerous drug studies are moving forward. Drug repurposing is defined as the application of known drugs to new indications. This approach is attractive, as repurposed drugs have already passed toxicity trials. Therefore, we aim to screen clinically approved drugs either as single or pair combinations for the therapeutic development of antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents to control and treat COVID-19 disease. We strongly anticipate the data generated will identify novel single or synergistic drug pairs, lead to detailed pre-clinical evaluation and provide the impetus for rapid progress to clinical trials or compassionate use in extreme cases.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4777.3","Queen's University of Belfast","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"6","6a","","",2

Small-batch GMP and clinical trials of the UOXF vaccine are already planned. Supported by the extensive human safety/ immunogenicity record of these vectors, and anticipating supportive primate efficacy/ immunopathology safety data in April, we are contingency planning an emergency clinical trial programme.

With Co-I J Humphreys (VMIC), we are contingency planning near-immediate access to 200L-capable cleanrooms at two CDMOs, both partners in this application (Cobra in Keele, UK & Halix in Leiden NL).    We have requested an emergency meeting with MHRA to discuss regulatory mechanisms to make vaccine available for large-scael use as soon as possible.","Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates are under development. ?ChAdOx1 nCoV?, developed at UOXF, is a leading candidate. In clinical trials, other vaccines based upon the same chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) technology have proven to be safe and to induce strong immune responses. In monkeys, a ChAd vaccine against the MERS virus (which is very similar to COVID-19)  achieved protection with a single dose. There was no evidence of vaccine-related worsening of immune damage to the lung (which has been problematic with other vaccines). To our knowledge, no other vaccine technology being applied to COVID19 has this track record of success (almost certainly no other vaccine under development in the UK).   We will soon be performing clinical trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV, but we need to prepare to manufacture millions of doses of it as soon as possible, in parallel with the clinical trials.

It seems highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 will cause disease and mortality unprecedented in modern times. Despite rapid publication of data from China, many unanswered questions remain that have immediate bearing on control and treatment of COVID-19: ?????????? Pathogen: how does transmission occur and over what period? What features of the virus drive transmission and severity? ?????????? Host: How can diagnosis be improved? How can severity be predicted? Does prior immunity to other viruses worsen disease severity? How does (non)pulmonary organ injury occur? Can therapy be tailored according to disease mechanisms? Which bacterial or fungal co-infections contribute to critical illness? This is a new disease. There is a high chance that clinical trials will fail to detect therapeutic effects, by enrolling at the wrong time, or missing key subgroups or endpoints. Deep biological phenotyping can mitigate these risks, providing rapid, efficient clinical evidence. Our response has been planned and tested over the past 8 years within the International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium (ISARIC). We will recruit at least the first 1300 consenting UK patients, and 1000 suspected cases, as the base of a coordinated national response, using our established, internationally-harmonized protocol (ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol) to: ?????????? Provide a unified foundation for clinical trials, enriching design and interpretation ?????????? Provide an open-access platform for evaluation of diagnostics and therapeutics ?????????? Establish a sample repository with independently-managed availability to researchers and to industry. ??????????

We will tackle many urgent questions that need answeringto help control the outbreak and treat patients in the UK:? how long are people infectious, and what body fluids are infectious?? what puts people at higher risk of severe illness?? what is the best way to diagnose the disease?? who should we treat early with drugs, and which drugs cause harm?? does the immune system in some patients do more harm than good?? what other infections(such as pneumonia or flu) happen at the same time?The UK needs a coordinated response to answer these questions as quickly as possible.Over the last 8 years we have been preparing for such a major outbreak; our expert teamis ready to immediately deploy and has already started collecting data and samples fromUK cases.The ISARIC-4C study will provide a foundation for other studies, such as clinical trials ofnew treatments, to help better understand the best way to use interventions.We will provide real-time information about the course of COVID-19 while studying theunderlying biology that explains illness severity with the goal of controlling spread andbetter treating those who contract it.",-77,1,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,"real-time data",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43489008,424206003,NA,NA,NA,-88,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4305.2","University of Edinburgh","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"1, 3, 4","1a, 1b, 1d, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b","","",2

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    Recently we have investigated antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and MERSCoV using a cohort (n=128) of SARS convalescent samples (serum and PBMC) collected during the 2003 outbreak in China. We isolated: ?????????? A panel of human mAbs (hmAbs) (n=12) specific to the cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by yeast-surface-display technology from PBMCs of SARS patients (Fig.1A) ?????????? Four of 12 hmAbs showing stronger neutralizing activities against both SARS- and MERS-CoVs in pseudotype (Fig.1B) or wild-type virus assays (Fig.1C), namely the CoV broadly neutralizing mAbs (CoV-bnMABs). Because a new highly pathogenic coronavirus (2019-nCoV renamed as SARS-CoV-2 by WHO on 11th Feb) outbreak occurred in December 2019 in China, we compared CoV sequences and alignments and found that the S protein (the major target of antibody response) of 2019-nCoV shares higher homology with SARS-CoV (77 %) as compared with MERS-CoV (35%). Thus, we hypothesize that some of CoV-bnMABs generated from SARS patients will cross react with SARS-CoV-2 in addition to MERS-CoV and SARSCoV. Indeed, our preliminary data (obtained on 9th Feb 2020) have shown that the CoVbnMABs can specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed on the surface of 293T cells (Fig.2). Therefore, we propose here to further characterize the CoV-bnMABs in terms of protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 while scaling up antibody production for IND-enabling CoVbnMAB CMC development, aiming to rapidly develop therapeutic antibodies for the current outbreak. Technically, in collaboration with a team of experts from UK and China, we will accomplish essential pre-clinical studies within 12 months and prepare for clinical trials.","Since December 2019 the emergence of severe acute respiratory infections (COVID-19)  caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in China has posed a huge threat to global  health, with rapid infection of more than 45,000 people and over 1000 deaths by February  11, 2020. Currently there is no effective treatment or vaccine available for CoV infections  in humans, largely due to the diversity of CoV family in wildlife and periodic zoonotic  transmission from animal hosts to humans. The aim of this proposal is to develop a group  of ?universal? therapeutic antibodies, called coronavirus broadly neutralizing monoclonal  antibodies (CoV-bnMABs), capable of treating and protecting against different members of  the CoV family including the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. We intend to bring CoVbnMABs  into clinical trial within a period of 12 months by characterization of their  specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 as well as protective efficacy and safety in animal models. The outcome of this study would address an immediate unmet medical need and could  provide effective tools against emerging pandemic CoV of the future.",-77,1,2020,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"therapeutic antibodies",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,85944001,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.7445.2","Imperial College London","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom, China","826, 156",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1, 6","1d, 6a","","",2

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    This proposal focuses on the molecular underpinning of enhanced transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and develop strategies to attenuate it to arrest viral spread. Viral infections spread based on their ability to overcome multiple barriers and move from cell to cell, tissue to tissue, person to person and even across species. Host expansion, transmissibility and tissue tropism of coronaviruses are primarily determined by host adaptations of the viral Spike. Alignment with related coronaviruses has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 Spike carries additional protease-cleavage sites. However, whether the SARS-CoV-2 Spike undergoes additional processing, the identity of cellular proteases involved and whether they confer enhanced transmissibility to SARS-CoV-2 is currently not known. To arrest the chain of transmission, we will determine: (i) the identity of the cellular proteases, (ii) whether inhibiting the proteases blocks virus transmission, (iii) whether blocking cleavage of the viral Spike itself blocks transmission. Using activity-based protein profiling we have captured serine-proteases that are specifically activated in SARS-CoV-2 infected samples but not in SARS- or MERS-CoV. We have already identified two such proteases and will scale-up to identify the others. We aim to inhibit these proteases both genetically and pharmacologically, to test functional consequences on virus transmission and tissue tropism. Additionally, we aim to mutate the proteolytic processing sites on the viral Spike itself, to assess effects on tissue tropism and transmission. Our unique combination of tools and expertise, puts us in an excellent position to study and inhibit transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus, which emerged in late 2019, has infected tens of thousands in China, and has now spread into 40 countries. To break the chain of transmission, host and viral determinants that increase the transmissability of SARS-CoV-2 need to be identified, in order to develope suitable and effective intervnetions. Two main determinants of virus transmission are the host cellular proteases that cleave the viral Spike protein to make it more infectious, and the viral Spiek itself that has evolved to carry additional protease-cleavage sites, allowing host expansion. We aim to identify these cellular proteases and inhibit them to block virus transmission. We also aim to generate virus with Spike proteins that cannot be cleaved, to determine whether we can arrest their spread. Collectively these approaches will be used to inform production of therapeutic molecules (against the proteases) and design of vaccines (against the viral Spike).",-77,1,2020,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,-88,NA,-88,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4991.5","University of Oxford","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1","1b","","",2

This project is intended to provide the evidence base for environmental infection control to help control transmission in the healthcare and other environments. The following questions will be addressed Does SARS-CoV-2 survive in the aerosol state in a range of environmental conditions and for how long? Can SARS-CoV-2 survive on a range of environmental surfaces found in healthcare facilities and domestic premises and for how long? Are commonly used room decontamination systems effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2? Are commonly used air sampling techniques capable of effectively sampling SARS-CoV-2 for subsequent analysis by PCR and plaque assay? All these questions will be addressed using fully developed published methodologies currently available at PHE Porton Down allowing the questions to be answered rapidly. The results of the studies will inform infection control practices and other linked studies carried out within healthcare facilities within the UK and internationally.","Understanding how the causatative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 is spread from person-to-person is essential for outbreak control. Little is known about the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 and establishing if/how the environment affects the survival and/or transmissibility (spread) of the virus is an immedate research priority (as identifed by the WHO Global Research and innovation Forum). This study will determine how long SARS-CoV-2 will survive in the air and on different types of surfaces (e.g. those found in the healthcare, domestic and community setting). Methods to effectively decontaminate these surfaces will also be investigated. Techniques will also be developed in order to develop validated sampling methods for the agent in healthcare facilities. Experiments will be carried out using specialist facilities and equipment at Public Health England and will be conducted under controlled environmental conditions (e.g. at a range of temperatures and humidities) representative of those found in different countries and/or settings. This study is essential if the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is to be fully understood. The results obtained will clarify how environmental factors can impact the spread of the virus and will inform effective (and evidence-based) strategies and guidance for preventing and controlling infection in healthcare and non-healthcare settings worldwide.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,-88,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.57981.32","Department of Health and Social Care","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1","1f","5","5b",2

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    Efficient response to COVID-19 requires an understanding of the epidemiological and behavioural drivers of disease transmission. Due to the rapidly evolving outbreak and the mitigation strategies likely to be put in place at different times, analyses of epidemic drivers and policy evaluation need constant updating to provide relevant data-driven evidence to inform evolving public health choices. We will provide rapid, continually updated estimates of key epidemiological features such as disease severity and transmissibility measures and lengths of stay. Surveillance, serological and sequence data (where available) will be analysed accounting for censoring and reporting delays. Mathematical models will be fit to the emerging data streams using Bayesian methods to provide regular forecasting updates and assess the impact of current or potential future interventions. Contact and precautionary behaviours will be monitored in a representative cohort along with information on risk awareness and perceived efficacy of interventions to refine transmission models, improve forecasting, and assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Special attention will be given to sharing results in an open and timely manner. Epidemiological parameter estimates and forecasts will be shared on a public website, updated daily. User-friendly web interfaces will allow users to generate model outputs and investigate the impact of specific model assumptions on different policy findings. Highlights of essential results will be gathered in short policy briefs updated weekly. Findings will immediately inform UK policy through participation on UK Government advisory committees.","Tracking and predicting an epidemic can help tailor public health measures so that we  respond quickly and appropriately to evolving threats. We will fit statistical models to  emerging data to monitor key epidemiological and clinical parameters related to  transmissibility and severity, and their likely impact on health services. Mathematical  models will be fitted to surveillance data to forecast future cases and hospitalisations and  evaluate the impact of different public health policies. Importantly, we will also measure  people?s behaviour over time to detect changes in response to the epidemic, assessing  what measures they take to reduce risk and where they get their evidence from. This  information will be used to refine our models and improve epidemiological forecasting. It  will also allow public health authorities to tailor their messaging to ensure that people  respond appropriately to changes in risk. The information that we generate, either from  our analyses of the emerging data, epidemic forecasts, or from our panel of respondents,  will be rapidly summarised and shared on easy-to-use websites so that scientists, health  workers and the public can be best informed about the threats posed by COVID-19 and  the efficacy of different measures to reduce risk.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,43489008,424206003,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.8991.9","London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3","3a, 3b, 3c","","",2

In the current COVID outbreak, there are case reports with variable outcomes reported for 18 women affected by nCoV in the third trimester, 50% delivered pre-term but there were no reports of vertical transmission. Therefore there are significant knowledgegaps regarding the impact of COVID-19 on mothers???????? and babies???????? health at all stages of pregnancy, including delivery and neonatal care, due to lack of primary data. SARS and MERS resulted in >25% case fatality in pregnant women, with worse effects in those infected in earlier pregnancy. AIMS To understand the natural history of COVID-19 in pregnancy, in order to guide treament and prevention during the outbreak. DELIVERABLES Registry: We will construct a registry of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, detailing presenting symptoms, clinical course, key diagnostic testing modalities and pathology results, adverse pregnancy outcomes, including vertical transmission, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. Pseudonymised data will be entered by health professionals via a password-protected web portal; the database will be hosted in an established clinical trials unitwith a study co-ordinator, senior data manager and statistician. We have a network of collaborators across Europe, China and USA to identify cases from these areas. Our senior project-partners in China and Hong Kong have expertise in women and children????????s health and epidemiology and will facilitate case reporting in areas which have a high prevalence of COVID-19 . This registry will be used to produce weekly online reports of aggregated, anonymised data during the outbreak to inform treatment and prevention during the outbreak, within the period of the grant. Data sharing (for pseudonymised individual participant data) will be made available for ethically approved research during and after the outbreak.","The current coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) is growing in magnitude and will affect hundreds of pregnant women globally. MERS, SARS, and other coronovirus infectionscause more severe illness in pregnant women than non-pregnant women, with higher rates of deaths, pregnancy loss, premature births and small-for-dates babies.There have been case reports of 18 women affected by COVID-19 in the later third of their pregnancy. There is a lack of information on the effect of COVID-19 at all stages of pregnancy e.g. early pregnancy and its effect on mothers? and babies? health before and after delivery.This study will gather information from around the world of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy to inform treatment and how to prevent spread.We will set up a database (register) of women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy. Cases will be added by collaborators across Europe, China, Hong Kong and the USA. Information about the women, their pregnancies and babies will be entered by healthcare professionals into a secure web page.Weekly reports from registery will be published online.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    Predicting the size and duration of potential COVID-19 outbreaks is an essential component of public-health planning and preparedness. Mathematical models of disease transmission are potentially powerful tools for predicting the course of an upcoming epidemic and evaluating control and mitigation strategies. However, standard models of disease transmission without population structure overestimate the speed of invasion of a novel pathogen. We have developed a spatial metapopulation transmission model for the UK that is grounded in demographic data which incorporates regular (commuter-like) movements of individuals. In previous work, we demonstrated that regular, repeated movements lead to slower epidemic spread. Adapting this model for COVID-19, we estimated that an uncontrolled epidemic in England and Wales would peak ~4 months following sustained person-to-person transmission, but that seasonality in transmission could substantially alter the timing and magnitude of the peak burden. Here, we propose to use this model to evaluate control and mitigation strategies for COVID-19. Guided by the World Health Organization-identified research priorities and PHE needs, we will estimate the impact of travel restrictions, border screening and quarantine policies. We will also assess the effects of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions on peak burden and epidemic timing and rank measures by effectiveness. The model will also be adapted to assess and rank pharmaceutical deployment strategies. Our vision is to make the model adaptable and available to other countries and settings, both with and without census and commuting data. Key challenges include modelling commuting patterns, incorporating realistic age structure, adding an observation model to capture morbidity and mortality and including behaviour change which could substantially alter dynamics.","A new strain of Coronavirus appeared in China at the end of 2019 and is spreadingbeyond Chinese borders. The purpose of this project is to minimise the number of seriouscases and deaths caused by the virus, following spread in the United Kingdom. We willuse the latest information about the UK population, the best biological information aboutthe virus to inform mathematical models that predict where and when the disease willspread and in what numbers. This information, rapidly communicated to the NHS willprovide the best opportunity to manage care and allocate resources proactively, inadvance of the arrival of new cases of Coronavirus.",-77,1,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-88,NA,NA,NA,-99,NA,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.8391.3","University of Exeter","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3","3a, 3c","","",2

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    This project will evaluate how an existing digital public health intervention can be very rapidly adapted and optimised for the changing needs of an infection outbreak, using novel participatory-co-design methods, and building on partnerships with PHE and leading Chinese researchers. We will translate and immediately widely disseminate in both UK and China our NICE-endorsed ??????Germ-Defence?????? digital infection control intervention for the general public. We will then engage with stakeholder (n=15) and PPI (n=20-30) online panels in each country to co-design, update and optimise the intervention as required for re-release in later and second phases of the outbreak. At every stage of dissemination we will document reach and impact using unobtrusive measures of usage and handwashing intentions and behaviour. We will triangulate these data with findings from online interviews with a purposive user sample (n=20-30) in each country to understand contextual effects on engagement. We will also carry out a rapid online trial in China (n = 1318) comparing the effects of the initial and adapted versions of the intervention on infection control beliefs, attitudes and behaviour, to evaluate the value of the adaptation process. This work is intended to contribute directly to the management of the outbreak by preventing infection transmission and slowing the spread of infection, so that the healthcare system will have more capacity to cope with demand. This work will also contribute to a better understanding of how to rapidly optimise public health interventions for future emergencies, and the factors influencing behaviour relevant to infection transmission.","The public can play a crucial role in infection outbreaks by adopting simple behaviours such as handwashing to curb the spread of infection. This can save lives by preventing everyone becoming ill at once, which would mean the healthcare system could not cope and a vaccine could not be developed in time. Evidence shows that despite public health advice most people need to increase behaviours such as handwashing that can help prevent infection. We developed an online intervention (?Germ-Defence?) that was tested in the swine flu pandemic and seasonal flu years. Germ-Defence increased handwashing and reduced infections and healthcare use. This new project will quickly work with stakeholders and users to adapt and translate Germ-Defence to be suitable for preventing infection from coronavirus (and other flu-like infections) in the UK and China. We will roll it out rapidly and widely in both countries, and collect online information about how it is used, how it affects people?s attitudes and behaviour, and users? views of it. We will use our findings to immediately update and improve Germ-Defence and to make recommendations and provide tools for adapting Germ-Defence and other public health advice for use in more countries and in future outbreaks.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,-99,NA,1,-99,NA,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.5491.9","University of Southampton","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom, China","826, 156",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,"9","9a, 9b","","",0

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    During public health emergencies policymakers are under incredible pressures from many sides, including the media, public, healthcare workers, and politicians. The decisions made have wide impacts on many sectors of society, especially healthcare workers at the front line of the outbreak response. This proposal responds to the theme of ??????understanding and influencing behaviour of institutions and individuals.?????ù We aim to understand better how UK policymakers arrive at decisions during the Covid-19 outbreak, and the impact of those decisions on UK healthcare workers. Making sense of policy decisions usually occurs after an outbreak, and thus can only impact on future events. Here we propose a novel prospective evaluation, monitoring conventional and social media data, and gathering information from key policy stakeholders (e.g. Jeremy Farrar and David Heymann) about their activities, and the drivers of policy choices (Work Package 1). In parallel we will purposively select key informants from primary care and hospital settings to gain insight into healthworker concerns and perceptions regarding the response to Covid-19, including views on service level adaptations following policy changes (Work Package 2). This work requires rapid activation to capture timely, valid information about attitudes during the outbreak, and deliver prompt results to policymakers. We are already piloting the research, with pump-prime funding from the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and will scale it with MRC support. Our team has extensive experience evaluating the impacts of policy in healthcare systems in the UK and internationally, leading to change in practice.","In an infectious disease outbreak public health policymakers are under tremendous  pressure, especially from the media. They must respond rapidly to and take decisions  which impact enormously on healthcare provision.  We are studying conventional and social media trends during the Covid-19 epidemic. We  will link these to changes in UK policy, gaining unique insights through collaboration with  key policy players. These include members of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts  (SAGE) that advises the Government, and Public Health England leaders.These experts are recording information on key meetings and events, and giving regular interviews so we  capture their perspectives in real-time.  We will also examine the impact of the policy changes on healthcare workers in general  practice and hospitals, through interviews and observations. We will learn their  perspective on delivering care during the epidemic, and how they perceive the changes in  policy. These findings will be fed back to policymakers during the outbreak.  Our approach is novel because policy decisions are usually only studied after an event,  making the findings less reliable.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    COVID-19 is set to become a global pandemic. Near real time information is needed to inform NHS planning and public health response. This includes community incidence (regardless of seeking care), risk factors for disease, clinical symptoms, case hospitalisation and mortality ratios, asymptomatic viral shedding, asymptomatic infection, household transmission risk and population behaviours during periods of wellness and illness (including social contact and movement, respiratory hygiene and health seeking behaviours). This information can only be gathered accurately through large scale community studies. Our experience of the MRC/Wellcome FluWatch study and ESRC BugWatch study allows us to rapidly establish two six-month national household cohorts (April-September 2020) and (October 2020-March 2021) of 25,000 individuals each (2,500 in each region of England and Wales) for online symptom and behaviour reporting and optional use of an app allowing their mobile phones to be used as GPS trackers enabling secure transfer and analysis of detailed movement patterns. Two sub-cohorts (10,000 individuals each) will also self-swab when ill for detection of COVID-19 and other circulating viruses. We will also conduct a London based study (200 households) following household contacts of COVID-19 cases for 28 days with daily symptom reporting, regular swabbing and baseline and follow up serology to investigate household transmission and asymptomatic infection and virus shedding. We will use data from Virus Watch to train whole population prediction models based on social media and search engine data and develop spatiotemporal models. Findings will be rapidly disseminated via online dashboards informing the public and decision makers.","The novel strain of Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused large numbers of deaths and  severe societal disruption in China and is predicted to become a global pandemic. To  prepare and respond we need to know how many people become infected, how many of  them become ill, what their symptoms are, how many seek health care, how commonly  they transmit to household contacts, what proportion need hospitalisation and what  proportion die. We need to understand how the population responds e.g. hand washing,  behaviours during and after coughing, sneezing or nose wiping, and whether people  restrict their movements and social contacts. Since many of those infected will have  relatively mild symptoms and not seek medical advice the only way to accurately obtain  this information is to conduct large scale community studies. We will follow up members of  the public and contacts of cases using regular online surveys of symptoms and  behaviours, secure tracking of participant movements, and testing for COVID-19 and other  respiratory infections to build a detailed picture of how the virus spreads and the  population responds. We will share this data with participants, health service and public  health planners and the general public to help minimise the impact of the virus.",-77,1,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,85944001,1,1,NA,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.83440.3b","University College London","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3, 4","3a, 3b, 3d, 4a, 4b","","",2

Measures to contain and delay COVID-19 in the UK include supported isolation for repatriated individuals, targeted advice to self-isolate for confirmed cases, contacts and symptomatic people, ??????shielding?????ù for extremely vulnerable people and social distancing for the rest of the population. Evidence suggests that advice to self-isolate is not always adhered to and experiencing supported or self-isolation can have detrimental effects on mental health and wellbeing. We aim to assess the effectiveness, acceptability and impact of isolation and distancing interventions to strengthen the current management of COVID-19.  We propose to implement a series of mixed-methods evaluations, focusing on supported and self-isolation and social distancing. This includes a rapid evaluation of supported isolation to assess adherence to advice and impact on mental health and wellbeing, using quantitative surveys and semi-structured interviews. We will also evaluate self-isolation and social distancing advice during the containment and delay phases, using a quantitative survey and follow-up interviews with people identified through contact tracing activities, extremely vulnerable ??????shielded?????ù individuals and the general population, to determine barriers and facilitators to adherence and assess the impact of advice on health and wellbeing, including identifying any differences between the different groups. Finally, an ethnographic study will focus on community responses in the UK and China through a series of narrative interviews and analysis of documentary sources. We will produce interim and final reports, focusing on policy and practice implications for management of supported isolation facilities, communicating advice to self-isolate and socially distance and the development of a communications strategy.","To help reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the containment phase, people retuning from affected countries and contacts of cases were advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others (self-isolate). In addition, people who were repatriated from affected countries were advised to stay in supported isolation facilities. During the delay phase, additional advice has been issued for anyone with symptoms to self-isolate and the whole population to stay at home and only leave their house if necessary (social distancing). Anyone with underlying health conditions has been advised to self-isolate for 12 weeks, regardless of symptoms.   We know that people do not always follow advice and experiencing isolation can have a negative impact on mental health and wellbeing. We will conduct surveys and interviews to assess whether people follow this advice, what might make following this advice difficult, what can be done to support people who are advised to isolate and the impact of isolation on mental health and wellbeing. We will also explore how UK and Chinese communities have responded to public health advice. Our findings will help with the management of the current COVID-19 outbreak and any future disease outbreaks requiring people to distance themselves from others.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,28335002,NA,-9999,NA,-88,-88,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.57981.32","Department of Health and Social Care","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom, China","826, 156",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"9","9a, 9c","10","10b",0

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    In preparing for a possible COVID-19 pandemic, estimates of severity, in particular of both the numbers of infections occurring at different levels of severity and the infection- and case-severity risks, are crucial to understand and predict the burden and impact of the epidemic on healthcare services. Such estimates are most importantly needed by age and risk group (e.g. defined by co-morbidities) strata, although in the early stages of an epidemic, strata-specific information is rarely available. No single dataset can provide enough information on its own to estimate severity, but estimation is feasible by synthesising multiple datasets, such as: line-listing data from first few hundred type studies; surveillance data including case counts, numbers accessing healthcare, and numbers of deaths; cohort studies; and household studies. Such a synthesis needs to account for biases inherent in each data source, including differential ascertainment by severity level; and to account for the incomplete nature of the data, which, collected in real time, are typically affected by censoring of final outcomes (recovery/hospital discharge or death). We propose to make the best use of both individual- and aggregate-level data that will become available, by using a combination of survival analysis techniques (e.g. curerate mixture or competing risks models) and Bayesian evidence synthesis in a single analysis to estimate severity in real time, as data accumulate over the course of the epidemic, and once the epidemic is over.","As we prepare for a possible COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the severity of the  epidemic, i.e. the proportion of infections that result in a severe event such as  hospitalisation or death, is crucial to monitoring and predicting the burden of the epidemic  on healthcare services. This burden is measured by the number of people infected who  require primary care from general practitioners, hospital admission, respiratory support  and/or admission to intensive care. Severity is quantified by infection-severity and caseseverity  risks, namely the probability that an infection (whether with or without symptoms)  or a symptomatic infection (clinical case) leads to a severe event. These quantities are  challenging to observe directly from a single dataset, as it is not possible to detect and  follow-up every case in a population, particularly early in the epidemic when case counts  may miss many asymptomatic or mild cases. The problem is compounded by the fact that  for patients still ill in hospital, we have not yet had time to observe whether they will  recover or not. We propose combining information from multiple datasets, both on  individuals and aggregated counts, to estimate severity while accounting for the  challenges of missing cases and not yet observing outcomes.",-77,1,2020,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Human dataset",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,-9999,-88,NA,-99,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.5335.0","University of Cambridge","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3","3b","","",2

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    EAVE (Early Estimation of vaccine and Anti-Viral Effectiveness) was a NIHR-funded project on pandemic influenza, which created a Scotland-wide cohort of 227,000 individuals recruited from 40 general practices together with stored serology samples from 1,000 individuals. EAVE established a national electronic cohort though linking health data sets from general practice, prescribing, hospitalisations and virology testing using the unique Community Health Identification (CHI) number for residents of Scotland. We plan to repurpose and expand this cohort to collect electronic data from 1.2m individuals living in Scotland to study COVID-19. We will augment the cohort by collecting and storing residual sera samples and by sequencing virus from patient specimens. Both of these, are being taken as part of routine care from a sample of these individuals. We will track the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in near real-time using the EAVE II cohort. We will be able to model the full course of the epidemic from genome sequence data. Once a serological test becomes available we will be able to refine this model and provide precise estimates of the attack rates in different sub-populations, and accompanying hospitalisation and fatality rates. EAVE II will help to identify the clinical features of the epidemic and, in due course, provide estimates of the effectiveness of any vaccines and anti-viral therapies deployed. Ethical and Privacy Committee approval has previously been given for the EAVE study and we anticipate the same approvals will readily be obtained for this follow-on study.","Scotland is an ideal place to carry out this research as there is a unique reference number for every individual. This makes it easy to link together different health datasets and construct an electronic cohort based upon data from 250 general practices and 1.2m individuals (22% of the population). Such a large cohort, gives wide regional coverage and permits investigation of subgroups such as children aged under 5 or adults over 65.  These data are already being collected for routine care - information on GP consultations, prescriptions, out of hours? consultations, use of accident and emergency and hospital admissions. It also includes laboratory tests to diagnose a person with coronavirus and specifically COVID-19. Individuals will be having routine blood tests and a sample of unused blood will be stored and eventually tested for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies to work out the proportion of the population exposed during the epidemic. We will also sequence virus genomes from a sample of patients. The analysis of these data is carried out in a safe haven using anonymised data so that individuals cannot be identified.  This cohort will be followed up to monitor the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic and to evaluate which interventions are effective for treating and preventing the virus.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43489008,424421007,NA,NA,-99,NA,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4305.2","University of Edinburgh","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1,3, 4","1c, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b","6, 7","6a, 7a",2

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    This COVID-19 paediatric sero-epidemiology study will adapt an existing national researchnetwork and ethically-approved NIHR-funded study to collect sufficient childhood andteenage serum samples for near real-time monitoring of increases in paediatric COVID-19sero-positivity rates across the UK in 2020.The importance of sero-epidemiological monitoring is emphasised in the Public HealthEngland (PHE) pandemic influenza protocol, currently being adapted in response to theCOVID-19 threat. This requires the monthly collection of 1000 serum samples, including100 per month in each of the 0-4, 5-9, 10-14 and 15-19 year old age-groups. This isessential to understanding the rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection inchildren, a population that are the predominant transmitters of most respiratory viruses.This information is in turn crucial to understanding the severity of COVID-19 disease inchildren, as well as modelling the spread of this virus through the community and planningan effective public health response.The challenge of obtaining blood samples from representative cohorts of children (ratherthan residual sera from sampling for clinical purposes) had already led to the OxfordVaccine Group (OVG), PHE and seven regional partners throughout England establishingthe ????????What????????s the STORY (Serum Testing of Representative Youngsters)???????? network toevaluate antibody levels against vaccine-preventable diseases. This study hascommenced, and with additional funding would be expanded to collect 3200 samplesthroughout 2020, including collection of individual level information on recent respiratoryillnesses and relevant medical history. Further extension would be possible if needed withappropriate resourcing. This study will form a rapid, responsive and crucial component ofthe UK response to this emerging global threat.","An important way of tracking the spread of a new viruses like the novel coronavirus  (COVID-19) is to study the blood-born immunity against that virus in the general  population.  Measuring this at the beginning of an outbreak can determine what proportion (if any) of  the population already have immunity, and ongoing monitoring for any increase in this  proportion can show how many people are getting new infections.  This is especially important for children, who are often responsible for spreading  respiratory infections to others.  Accordingly, Public Health England plan to study the concentrations of antibodies (a  marker of immunity) against COVID-19 in 400 children and teenagers per month for the  duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,-99,NA,NA,-88,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4991.5","University of Oxford","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1, 3","1d, 3a, 3b","4","4a, 4b",1

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    This project aims to rapidly progress a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine against the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to first in human studies (phase I) within a matter of months. Within 14 days of accessing the sequence we have already designed and constructed a candidate saRNA vaccine expressing a pre-fusion stabilised conformation of the native surface glycoprotein (S-protein). This design maximises the potential for induction of neutralising antibodies while minimising the induction for off-target responses to post-fusion conformations. We have engaged key manufacturing partners able to generate GMP material not only for phase I/II studies according to a very tight schedule but also with the capability to rapidly scale to millions of doses should this be required. This cutting-edge nucleic acid vaccine platform has been specifically designed for rapid manufacture and deployment in the event of an outbreak. SaRNA offers significant advantages over other nucleic acid vaccine platforms yielding exponentially higher levels of protein expression than messenger RNA (mRNA) or DNA. The self-amplifying properties of saRNA mean that much lower doses are required to induce protective immunity, providing a significant advantage to manufacturing costs and speed. Additionally, saRNA is not limited by anti-vector immunity and is safe to administer to individuals unable to receive live attenuated vaccines (e.g. children and the immunocompromised). The Target Product Profile (TPP) is a vaccine that can be rapidly manufactured at low cost and elicit protective immunity across all at risk populations within 6 weeks of administration, with the potential for repeat boosting as required.","We will rapidly progress a synthetic vaccine against the novel Coronavirus into human  studies within months. We have determined the genetic sequence (code) for the dominant  surface exposed protein of the virus, the key target for protective immune responses. We  have modified this sequence to express a highly stabilised version of the protein,  maximising its potential to evoke protective antibodies. We have used this modified  sequence to generate a ribonucleic acid (RNA) based vaccine that can be amplified within  cells following injection, maximising its expression. Our RNA vaccine delivers the genetic  instructions that tell muscles to make the viral surface protein which alerts the immune  system to make protective antibodies. The advantage of our fully synthetic manufacturing  process means that millions of doses can be made within weeks. This project will support  clinical grade manufacturing of our candidate vaccine, preclinical safety testing and  healthy volunteer studies to assess safety and immune potency of our vaccine. Should  this first phase be successful we would progress to wider clinical testing, including studies  to determine its protective effects against natural infection before making our vaccine  widely available.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,-88,NA,NA,NA,-88,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.7445.2","Imperial College London","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"7","7a","3","3c",0
"C00205","MC_PC_19077","Development of an ovine polyclonal immunoglobulin therapy against COVID-19.","Development of an ovine polyclonal immunoglobulin therapy against COVID-19.",557150,"This COVID-19 Rapid Response award is jointly funded (50:50) between the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research.  The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    The new coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a pathogen termed SARS-CoV-2. To develop a rapid and effective therapy against infection, we are proposing to develop an ovine immunoglobulin treatment against the spike protein of this virus. Binding of antibodies to this protein will neutralise cell entry and prevent it's infectivity. Use of ovine immunoglobulin therapy is widespread for other applications, and a therapy rapidly developed for Ebola virus disease (termed EBOTAb) which demonstrated protection in guinea pigs and non-human primates. The use of polyclonal sera recognising muitiple epitopes eliminates risks of escape mutations occuring and eliminating the effectiveness of antibody therapy. This approach is also rapid, cost-effective and has a proven path to regulatory approval. To develop this therapy, recombinant spike protein will be produced in a mammalian expression system to ensure relevant protein folding and confirmation. A large batch will be produced for immunisation of sheep. Immunisations will be conducted using a facility in Australia, to mitigate risks associated with BSE. Sera will be sent to PHE for assessment of antibody levels and once sufficient antibody levels are achieved, plasmapheresis sampling will be undertaken. Immunoglobulin from these samples will be purified to develop the therapeutic material. This will be characterised at PHE for binding and functional properties before being testing using a susceptible animal model for protection against infection and disease progression.","Interventions against the newly emerged coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are urgently required. Antibody approaches are widely recognised as an appropriate method due to their ability to bind proteins which can disrupt entry into cells. Antibodies which are polyclonal, so bind to multiple areas of the protein, are preferential in that small changes in the virus associated with mutations will have little effect compared to monoclonal antibodies which only recognise a single site. Ovine antibodies are suitable for development as large volumes can rapidly be made and they are widely used for treatment for other applications, including antivenoms. For this proposal, we will raise antibodies against the spike protein of the causative agent of COVID-19, termed SARS-CoV-2. The protein will be recombinantly manufactured before being used to immunise sheep. The sheep side will be conducted in Australia due to regulatory issues around BSE, so countries free of BSE need to be used. Once a sufficient level of antibodies are detected in the sheep, they will used as donors to provide plasma samples from which the antibodies can be purified. These will then be used as a therapeutic and tested for their effects against COVID-19 disease progression in a susceptible animal model.",-77,-77,2020,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,NA,-88,85944001,NA,-99,NA,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.57981.32","Department of Health and Social Care","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom, Australia","826, 36",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"6","6a","1","1d",0

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    The escalating numbers of affected individuals in China and the potential for importation of this infection to the UK during the pre-symptomatic and potentially infectious stage renders containment problematic. Acute diagnostic PCR is of short duration usefulness in identifying those recovered from the infection. The pattern of disease is clinically diffuse rendering identification of previous infections through clinical history very difficult. Here we describe the commitment of an exceptional and highly capable scientific group who, including the PI, have previously developed specific, sensitive serology for Ebola, Zika and Lassa. The Ebola tests were instrumental in the identification of seropositive persons who had recovered silently from Ebola and characterising their antibody response. Following the same methodology for SARS-CoV-2 will allow specific detection of antibody rather than placing reliance on SARS serological assays, permitting measurement of the penetration of this infection into any susceptible population. A test format will also be developed for the non-invasive sampling of oral fluid for G and M class antibody. Recombinant envelope proteins S1 and S2 and nucleoprotein will allow the sensitive detection of antibody. Our assays, also adaptable for Point of Care and diagnostic use, will be rendered specific by described methods for conjugate quenching previously developed by the group for Zika(1). Having serology which is diagnostically important for public health, herd immunity measures will also enable establishing WHO international standards. Measurement of neutralising antibody will be important for vaccine studies and characterisation of convalescent plasma(2).","The principal method protecting susceptible populations from the importation of the novel Chinese coronavirus is to quarantine individuals at risk of the infection when they enter the country. If a person has symptoms of a chest infection it may be possible to diagnose or exclude coronavirus by a specific test for the virus. The limitation is that some people may have no symptoms and not be tested and indeed some may have been infected and recovered from the virus by the time of this testing. At present we have no specific serological method of detecting past infection with SARS-CoV-2 which may be important in defining unexpected infection risks. In practice this crucial lack can mean that ongoing transmission of virus infection may remain undetected. This programme of work will develop diagnostic tests a way in which samples can easily be taken by sampling fluid from the mouth and tested for antibody. An additional advantage is that this can allow screening of potential donors recovered from infection whose blood contain high levels of antibody which may be appropriate for treating patients with severe disease at a time that there are no recognised effective antiviral agents for patients.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-88,424206003,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.7445.2","Imperial College London","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1","1a, 1d","","",2

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    COVID-19 disproportionately affects people ?????? 50 years old with comorbidities and those ?????? 65 years old.  No specific treatment has yet been proven in rigorous clinical trials to be effective against COVID-19. Most  clinical trials are hospital-based. Yet, most cases are managed in the community, so  interventions proven to be effective are urgently  in primary care that prevent hospitalisation and speed recovery.  PRINCIPLE will be a Phase III, platform, response-adaptive, open-label randomised controlled trial in primary care.  The platform trial will  operate under a master protocol that allows the addition or replacement of further interventions.    Outcome data will be analysed as the trial is in progress: if  evidence emerges that one arm is more effective, we might be able to allocate more people to that arm.  PRINCIPLE will, in the first instance, evaluate usual care plus hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice a day for 7 days. This drug  is already in wide use, but not for this indication.  The comparator will be usual care without a study drug.  Eligible patients will be aged  ??????50-64 years with a defined comorbidity, and patients aged ??????65 with or without comorbidity presenting within 7 days since onset of symptoms with a new continuous cough and/or high temperature during time of prevalent COVID-19 infection.   Approximately 3000 eligible participants will need to be randomised in the first instance in order to determine whether the first drug we plan to evaluate is more effective than usual care alone in preventing hospital admission and/or death in people with suspected COVID-19.","We do not yet have any treatments for COVID-19 patients, so we are now running a clinical trial to test out drugs which may work. Most COVID 19 cases are managed in the community and it is essential that we find treatments that help reduce hospital admission and speed recovery. The risk of complications from suspected COVID-19 infection is generally greater in people aged 50 years and older with underlying health conditions and in those aged 65 years and older. Therefore, we will ask these two groups to take part in our trial. The first drug we will evaluate is hydroxychloroquine, which is already used for other illnesses, but but it has not been tested in patients with suspected COVIS-19 in the community. Therefore, we do not yet know if hydroxychloroquine, (or any future treatments that we include in the trial), given to COVID-19 patients, will help reduce the need for hospitalisation or speed up recovery. All people initially included in the study will have a test for COVID-19, and will either receive usual best care, or usual best care plus the drug we are testing, currently hydroxychloroquine.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    PHE Porton's extensive experience in the development of high containment infectious disease models will be applied to set up the UK's first primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This will be achieved by intra-tracheal infection using a virus stock of SARS-CoV-2 acquired through international collaboration. PHE's Victoria stock of virus has been propagated in vitro and has already been used to challenge ferrets at PHE Porton. PHE will also assess the ability of a crude (killed whole virus) vaccine to induce immune mediated disease enhancement. This will be achieved by serially immunising NHPs and then infecting them with live SARS-CoV-2. PHE will assess the clinical signs of infection as well as assessing lung pathology in-life through X-ray and/or CT imaging. In this way, if unusal pathology is observed in the immunised groups, PHE will have set up a ""positive control"" ADE model to help discriminate vaccines or therapies which assist the host or accidentally enhance the immunopathology of acquired infection.","The three important things that are urgently required to fight SARS-CoV-2 are prevention, and protection & treatment. Prevention is being implemented by screening and self isolation but as the number of countries reporting cases has risen to 29, the lack of a licenced vaccine or therapeutic to protect patients is increasingly important. PHE propose to develop a model of infection to evaluate interventions. Additionally, we need to develop a model to assess safety as there are concerns that some vaccines or treatments may accidentally enhance the disease. We cannot ethically test this in humans and we cannot risk using vaccines without checking that the vaccine or therapy is safe.

This project will test if this complication is relevant for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV-1.

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    The further spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outside China, causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally has led to an outbreak that WHO announced 12 March 2020 as a pandemic. The role of Healthcare Workers (HCWs) in managing the outbreak is critical, while working in a setting where they may be inadvertently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and WHO has prioritised research on how best to protect them from infection and disease. The similar ????????Public Health Emergencies of International Concern?????????? caused by Zika and Ebola highlighted another important aspect: the need to integrate social sciences research into the outbreak response and to address ethical questions around studies and data sharing, in this context involving HCWs. With our proposal, we aim to integrate three key priorities in a unique way. We will leverage existing funding and our experience within the ICONIC study, funded by the Wellcome Trust/DoH (2014-18). We propose an in-depth analysis of risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs including longitudinal sampling, tracking of movement and studies of behaviours and influences on them (capability, opportunity and motivation). We will perform a virological analysis of infected patients with serial samples to construct a detailed analysis of transmission clusters. The latter will provide valuable clinical data on virus shedding. Finally, we propose to address the ethical questions around the use of apps and wearables, data sharing and conducting studies during an outbreak to produce a set of definitive recommendations for policy makers.","Coronaviruses transmit easily, the disease is highly infectious and can lead to serious illness and death. Healthcare workers becoming ill in large numbers would have a huge impact on health care provision. Bed shortages in over-stretched hospitals are common and the additional burden from coronavirus could bring staff to breaking point. We had a unique opportunity in 2017/8 to investigate healthcare workers at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) infected with influenza compared to those who were well. There is lack of evidence around the risk of coronavirus so we now propose a study that will examine the rates at which healthcare workers become infected with coronavirus in three wards and A/E at UCLH, using the same methods as before. We will also interview healthcare workers to find out their challenges in preventing infection spreading to themselves, other staff and patients, while working during a novel pathogen outbreak. We will use antigen tests to rapidly screen them to see if they are infected with coronavirus, and complement these with antibody tests. This information will add significantly to the understanding of staff health and safety, hospital infection prevention and control, and will improve the evidence-base for the protection of patients and staff.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,1,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,-99,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.83440.3b","University College London","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1, 3","1b, 3a","","",1

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    The WHO database of research on COVID-19 contains 589 studies, the majority of which are on virology, epidemiology and clinical management. Only two (Kavanagh 2020; McCloskey et al. 2020); discuss (but do not report research on) wider governance issues. Yet the Chinese Communist Party leadership??????s response to the epidemic has been comprehensive well beyond clinical management. It has set up high level coordinating mechanisms across government ministries that have issued hundreds of policy documents setting out containment measures. In this way it has mobilized Party and government organizations across (for example) social care, transport, and policing that reach through local governments into every work place and community. It has used TV, print and social media to communicate measures with the public, while the public have used social media as well as self-organization to respond to measures whether by complaining and criticizing or by supporting and complementing government measures. This project will: systematically compile a database of policy documents (available from Chinese government websites) that set out containment measures as they are evolving through the epidemic; use text and computational analysis of newspapers and social media databases (Weibo Scope and WeChat Scope) we will purchase; and conduct local fieldwork (qualitative interviews) to analyse the societal impacts in urban and rural areas and responses on social media and (focussing on companies, and NGOs and citizens) in four carefully chosen localities (Hubei, Beijing, Guangdong and Anhui). The result will be important and novel resources mapping and assessing Chinese containment measures and their societal impacts, that will be communicated and updated regularly for national and international governments and organizations attempting to tackle COVID-19 around the world.","We urgently need to understand Chinese government measures to contain COVID-19. Rates of infection seem to be slowing in China, but they are accelerating worldwide. Given the apparent success of Chinese measures, other countries may consider adopting them. Yet we do not fully understand China?s measures ? which extend well beyond health and clinical management ? or their effects. Anecdotal evidence indicates that some measures created significant new problems, both for containing the virus (e.g. closing transport from the outbreak centre hampered the inward flow of medical supplies) and for members of Chinese society (e.g. quarantining those infected sometimes left dependents without carers). This project will use documentary policy and media analysis and fieldwork in four localities in China, to understand: the full range of measures taken by the Chinese government; how they were communicated to the population; their urban and rural societal effects (as well as their role in containing the virus); how the public responded to the measures; and whether public responses fed back to change policies. As the epidemic evolves in China we will regularly prepare short reports and online or in-person briefings that track policies and discuss evidence of their effects and arising ethical issues to create valuable resources for policy makers internationally.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,424206003,85944001,1,-88,-88,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.8756.c","University of Glasgow","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom, China","826, 156",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"9","9a","","",0

The figure displayed is the total award amount of the two funders combined, with each partner contributing equally towards the project.    With surging numbers of total confirmed cases and deaths, the UK has entered the most stringent social distancing stage in history. Of all the key worker groups, delivery workers is the one has most gig workers who are precariously employed. Huge spikes in demand have been reported by supermarkets, online grocers and food delivery services. The employers have responded by hiring more workers or requiring existing employees to work longer shifts. Certain epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19, namely subclinical transmission, incubation period and varying viability on surfaces, present significant challenges to protect delivery workers. We aim to understand, based on different scenarios of risk mitigation measures and social distancing strategies, 1) how delivery workers contribute to the UK??????s national response by delivering to households and hence reduce number of outgoing trips; and 2) how delivery workers could potentially contribute to transmission. We will collect data from key stakeholders of the sector to understand how the supply chains and delivery workers responded to the COVID19 outbreak and to build scenarios for mathematical modelling. Using these models we will assess the impact (positive and negative) of current delivery activities, as well as additional scenarios reflecting stricter lockdown conditions, taking into account effect of risk mitigation measures, by considering the number and nature of contacts they made in the communities (including vulnerable groups). Household transmission models will be used with external forcing into households and infection back to gig workers directly considered.","Home-isolation and lockdown are necessary for preventing infectious disease transmission, with many of our basic needs provided by platform companies and delivery workers. This sector plays a vital role in reinforcing the infection control measures and reducing public anxiety by keeping logistics functioning and services and supplies available. Mounting anecdotal evidence suggests that gig workers are unsung heroes and deserve more attention and protection. We aim to understand how gig workers, with a focus on delivery workers, have contributed to suppressing transmission by increased delivery to households. In addition, we consider the possibility that they could become a route of transmission if adequate occupational health protection is not provided. We will conduct focus groups and interviews with industry participants and delivery workers to collect data on the volume and pattern of deliveries. We will then use mathematical models to determine how the delivery sector contributes to minimising the risk of spreading the disease and the impact of additional measures to protect the workers and reduce infection risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcome will inform the UK?s policy making in social distancing and coordination of supply chains as a key component of national response.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-88,424421007,-9999,-99,-9999,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.5379.8","The University of Manchester","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0

A Public Health Emergency was declared for COVID-19 to galvanize global collaboration  to support less resources nations; this must include research to address the unknowns  and ensure equity in who benefits from findings and interventions. We propose to further  develop a proven mechanism for supporting locally-led evidence generation by facilitating  knowledge sharing between all the networks and getting information and support to where  research capacity is low. During the Ebola and Zika outbreak The Global Health Network  served an important role in delivering and sharing trusted research tools, guidance and  training which facilitated faster, standardised quality data capture. Beyond these  outbreaks we have been working with our partners to create lasting research networks to  support evidence generation in challenging settings. Here we will take our experience and  add new innovative technology to make highly targeted information, tools and resources  discoverable and support rapid implementation of new knowledge as this outbreak  evolves. Our global partners are asking for such a mechanism, and here we can use the  platform, our community, technolology and expertise to address the immediate need for  global sharing and research support at this crucial point. What we learn here can then be  applied to future outbreaks.","COVID-19 is a new virus and therefore there are many unknowns that need to be  answered through research. Setting up studies takes a long time and there are many  places in the world with low research capability and experience. Therefore, we need to  find a way to get all the organisations, networks and teams working on this outbreak to  share not only what they are discovering, but also how they do their research. This could  help all countries to run their own studies by sharing the methods and systems that have  been developed, and by providing guidance and support on how to run these studies in  their clinics and hospitals. We need all types of research in outbreaks, not just to test  drugs and vaccines but also to understand the social context so that locally appropriate  public health messages and measures can be implemented. Better diagnostics are also  critical to avoid over-burdening hospitals. We learnt much during the Zika and Ebola  outbreaks and many initiatives and networks were set up. Here we build on these  collaborations and our experience within our wide, global community to help countries at  the most risk to also take part and benefit from research.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-99,-9999,-9999,1,-99,-88,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.4991.5","University of Oxford","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"11","11e","6","6a",0

The current coronavirus pandemic is a novel challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. The virus is currently spreading at alarming rates in Asia, Europe and North America, and it is essential that African countries prepare for the arrival and local transmission of SARSCoV- 2 and develop effective response mechanism. The African MRC Units have a critical role to play in researching the epidemic but also in supporting local health systems in this response. In Uganda, diagnostic capacity is to our knowledge currently limited to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI, Entebbe) and Central Public Health Laboratories (CPHL, Kampala).  Given the rapid spread of the virus globally, there is a high risk the first positive cases will be detected in Uganda over the next few weeks. Lessons learnt from other countries suggest that the ability to rapidly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 positive samples is critical in controlling the pandemic. However, given the pace of virus spread seen in Asia, Europe and the US, the local diagnostic capacity will need to be increased substantially to handle the anticipated increase in suspected cases. The Unit has well-trained laboratory staff, robust procedures and excellent facilities which could support the national effort to prevent and contain an outbreak in Uganda. Support Capacity: The Unit intends to prepare for supporting the national diagnostic capacity by offering up to 2,500 tests per month over the next 4 months. Full virus genome sequences would be generated from a subset of positive samples, the resulting data would support the international effort in understanding the regional movement of the virus and would monitor for virus changes that might influence diagnostics or the pathology of the virus.","N/A",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,-88,NA,NA,1,NA,-88,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit","Uganda","800",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Uganda","800",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1","1a, 1b, 1c","12","12c",2

Other contributions are from DHSC  and Wellcome via Wellcome Sanger. The current COVID-19 pandemic represents a major threat to health in the UK and globally. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing capacity in UK NHS clinical microbiology network and within Public Health England (PHE) is of limited daily capacity. However, the UK has world leading expertise in genomics within PHE, at multiple regional University hubs, and within large centres such as the Wellcome Sanger Institute.  The proposed COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) ???????? Consortium, will deliver a large scale and rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing capacity to local NHS centres and the UK government at pace. The primary achievement of this consortium will be the generation of actionable data which when combined with epidemiological and clinical information has the potential to inform interventions and policy decisions during the current UK COVID-19 epidemic. This sequencing capacity will enable real time evaluation of novel treatments and non-pharmacological interventions on SARS-CoV-2 populations and spread, and provide information on introductions versus community transmission and outbreaks. It will also evaluate signals of changing transmissibility and virulence. In the longer term, the full integration of UK population level SARS-CoV-2 genomics data, with matching NHS electronic health records, patient outcomes, human genomics and metagenomics data has the potential to generate insights into susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Finally, the substantial new nationwide capacity in sequencing infrastructure, informatics and personnel that will be built by COG-UK will remain at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic as significant asset for the NHS, UKRI and UK Government.","N/A",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,NA,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,-88,NA,NA,-88,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.57981.32","Department of Health and Social Care","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"12","12a, 12b","1, 3, 6, 9","1c, 3a, 3c, 6k, 9e",2

The viral entry of coronaviruses is based on binding of the viral spike protein (S protein) to cellular receptors and on S protein processing by host cell proteases. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 uses the human receptor ACE2 for cell entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for ""priming"" the S protein. The protease inhibitor Camostat, which has already been used clinically, reduces cell infection. So far, this has only been shown in cell lines or cell cultures that do not reflect the complexity of the three-dimensional alveolar lung cell association with type I, type II cells, endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages. The aim of the proposed project is to test Camostat in a preclinical model of human ex vivo lung cultures to better estimate the therapeutic potency of Camostat in COVID-19. The effects of Camostat in different doses at different times of infection of human ex vivo cultivated and infected with SARS-CoV-2 lung tissue are to be tested. Viral replication and the formation of interferons and selected pro-inflammatory cytokines are determined. These are the primary relevant readout parameters in an established model, supernatants and tissue are recorded in a biobank for follow-up analyzes.

These studies include, for example, the ??????Solidarity Trial of the WHO?????ù or the comparable DisCOVery Trial under the leadership of the French Institute de la Sant???? et de la Recherche M????dicale (INSERM). These studies are intended to test specific active substances in as many clinics and as many countries as possible on a large number of patients, for which there are first indications of effectiveness against COVID-19. These include, for example, an antiviral drug that was originally developed for Ebola, two malaria drugs, or combinations of drugs.

Thus, we aim within the proposed project to characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes from all known proteins of the virus covering the most common HLA allotypes. Using ELISpot assays we will perform a high-throughput screening of 120 potential SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and class II T-cell epitopes predicted by the established algorithms SYFPEITHI and NetMHCpan using PBMCs from volunteer donors that recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-VD). Validated T-cell epitopes will be further used to characterize SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This approach will finally allow to i) gain more detailed knowledge about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the immune system, ii) provide novel diagnostic tools to identify and monitor people with SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and most important iii) define possible target structures for the development of virus-specific immunotherapies for the treatment of the COVID-19 disease.","SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently poses a serious threat to the world population, calling for the rapid development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

This approach will finally allow to i) gain more detailed knowledge about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the immune system, ii) provide novel diagnostic tools to identify and monitore people with SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and most important iii) define possible target structures for the development of virus-specific immunotherapies for the treatment of the COVID-19 disease.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43489008,-99,85944001,NA,-99,NA,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","Eberhard Karls Universit?t TÅbingen","Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1","1a, 1d","6","6a",2

Economic stress, the public health emergency and disinformation-driven panic have pushed customers, and vendors, towards the shadow economy. In particular, Dark web marketplaces (DWMs), commercial websites easily accessible via free software like Tor, have acquired significant popularity. They accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to broker transactions often involving drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods. UK presence on DWMs is strong: As of April 6, 86% of COVID-19 related listings on DWMs would ship to UK and 45% were shipped from UK. This project will build an infrastructure to monitor dark web trading in COVID-19-related goods and services. First, we will monitor listings on DWMs to detect changes in types and prices of COVID-19-related goods and services (e.g., face masks, prescription drugs, scams). Second, we will analyse patterns of Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) transactions involving DWMs and their users to quantify policy-relevant changes in trading activity patterns and customer behaviour. The rapid evolution of the pandemic requires gathering and analysing critical data quickly, and a strong research effort to improve the current understanding of DWMs. Our interdisciplinary research team is perfectly equipped for this challenge. Live results shared in reports and a dedicate website will (i) uncover market demand and supply of critical goods and services, (ii) support policymakers' plans for their provision and (iii) assist and complement the UK's effort to combat disinformation about coronavirus, scams, and to counter panic-buying of counterfeit goods that could threat public health.","The pandemic has reshaped the demand for goods and services worldwide.

Live results shared in reports and a dedicate website will (i) uncover market demand and supply of critical goods and services, (ii) support policymakers? plans for their provision and (iii) assist and complement the UK?s effort to combat disinformation about coronavirus, scams, and to counter panic-buying of counterfeit goods that could threat public health.",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,424421007,85944001,NA,-99,NA,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.28577.3f","City University of London","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"9, 10","9c, 10d","","",2

After inactivation by paraformaldehyde, these transportable plates will be sent to the lab of HE who will elaborately phenotype the cells using an established imaging pipeline. RK will compare the hits from the screen to time-lapse proteomics data of SARS-CoV-2 infected human epithelial host cells (data was derived from SC recently), omics data from other coronavirus infection studies, and gene associations to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. This will lead to a short list of host dependency factors for which drugs will be selected employing publicly available drug databases. Selected host factors and drugs will be validated in the lab of SC employing a broad selection of SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

Those plates are containing dried siRNA/transfection reagent complexes. When the cells attach to the surface, reverse transfection enables siRNA mediated knockdown of a single gene, in high-throughput. Then, the cells will be infected with clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected by SC and cCytopathic effect and MTT assays performed. After inactivation by paraformaldehyde, these transportable plates will be sent to the lab of HE who will elaborately phenotype the cells using an established imaging pipeline. RK will compare the hits from the screen to time-lapse proteomics data of SARS-CoV-2 infected human epithelial host cells (data was derived from SC recently), omics data from other coronavirus infection studies, and gene associations to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. This will lead to a short list of host dependency factors for which drugs will be selected employing publicly available drug databases. Selected host factors and drugs will be validated in the lab of SC employing a broad selection of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. In addition, RK will infer a SARS-CoV-2 specific protein interaction network and identify clusters of host factors to get drug combinations, which will be experimentally validated by SC. We will yield an effective drug treatment for COVID-19 therapy and prevention.; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,-99,85944001,-88,-99,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit?t Frankfurt am Main","Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"6","6a","1","1b",0

Up to now, no vaccines or efficient therapeutic strategies are available. Many clinical approaches focus on repurposing of approved therapeutics against other diseases. However, efficacy of these compounds on viral infection or even harmful secondary effects in context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is sparsely investigated. Similarly, adverse events of commonly used therapeutics against lifestyle diseases are unknown. Major problems correlated to COVID-19 are lung tissue damage, dysregulation of the innate immune response and abnormal coagulation parameters. To investigate processes that maintain lung homeostasis, we have established a human alveolus-on-a-chip model, which is composed of epithelial-cells and endothelial-cells as well as macrophages. By use of this system, the alveolar homeostasis, which is easily dysbalanced by infections, can be examined. We will investigate (a) the replication efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in epithelial and endothelial cells, (b) the effects of infection on innate immune response (c) the barrier integrity and regulation of vascular coagulation and fibrinolysis system and (d) the effects of commonly used therapeutics on SARS-CoV-2 infection that also act on the vascular system.

Furthermore, ACE2 protein was found to be higher in E1 cells, while Icatibant, a licensed drug, inhibits ACE2 up-regulation in E1 cells.Outlook: The proposed project sheds light epithelial immune response triggered by SARS-Cov2 in context of the E1 differentiation pathway and offers novel solutions for diagnosis and therapy.""; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,-88,424206003,-9999,-88,NA,-88,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","Helmholtz Zentrum MÅnchen Deutsches Forschungszentrum fÅr Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), Neuherberg","Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"6","6a","1","1a, 1d",0

Probably most of the infected children remain undetected due to the lack of clinical symptoms. The rate of seroconversion can be assessed by measuring SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies 2-4 weeks after the infection.The aim is to estimate the rate of seroconversion to SARS- CoV-2 in a large and unselected sample of asymptomatic children at defined time points (screening examinations in outpatient practices) in an urban region of North-Rhine-Westphalia. Symptoms and history of COVID-19 symptoms will be assessed and IgA and IgG antibodies measured.  Possible risk factors for SARS- CoV-2 infection from the patient??????s history (e.g. co-morbidity, smoking exposure, social aspects etc.) will be detected. Frequency of infections and pulmonary symptoms in seropositive/negative children symptoms during the one year follow- up are recorded. Additionally, the rate of seroconversion in mother-child pairs (concordant vs discordant) will be evaluated in order to estimate the risk of exposure. Variations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 will be measured since angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)  l  seem to play a crucial role for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Since different expression of these receptors could explain the differences in severity of COVID-19 infection in children vs. adults, a subgroup of children and mothers will be selected for later RNA analyses in nasal and oral mucosae.""; Research Type: epidemiological study; Study population: children and adolescents","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-9999,-99,NA,NA,-88,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.5570.7","Ruhr- Universit?t Bochum","Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3","3b","","",0

Targeting unique mechanisms for COVID-19 therapy","",1299288.54,"Abstract: ""Eisbach has identified and validated small molecule drugs that target disease-relevant and novel mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2. Using an allosteric HTS and in vivo platform, we identified ~300 helicase inhibitors and ~60 inhibitors targeting the ADP-ribose-binding macrodomain of ALC1/CHD1L, an oncogene. We observe high sequence/structure conservation with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase and Nsp3 X-domain macrodomain mono-ADP-ribosylhyrolase, enzymes for which we have pioneering, worldwide expertise. Since the viral helicase and one of the macrodomains of SARS-CoV-2 are essential for viral replication and to suppress the host????????s immune system, they represent novel, highly promising drug targets. Our AI-supported molecular docking algorithm validated a binding pocket in the helicase, in particular. The 87 cell-permeable, drug-like and cell-active inhibitors that we have profiled are predicted to be high nanomolar SARS-CoV-2 blockers, have been profiled for toxicity, physchem properties and in silico ADMET. This will enable rapid lead optimization.  The objectives of our grant are to develop a pre-clinical proof-of-concept for small molecule inhibitors toward the treatment of COVID-19 and other, future CoV infections. Our rationale for validating these novel inhibitors toward helicase and macrodomain ADP-ribosyl hydrolase enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 lies in the novelty of our targets, the orthogonal approach we have taken to identify small molecule inhibitors that target the helicase outside of its canonical ATP binding pocket and the specific coronavirus functions that our drugs disrupt.""; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43489008,NA,85944001,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","Eisbach GmbH, Martinsried","Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"6","6a","","",2
"C00828","01KI2058","Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids","Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung organoids",423607.04,"Abstract: ""Organoids are three dimensional tissues derived from stem cells. The usage of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) enables the differentiation into organoids with human tissue-like features. iPSC can also be used to differentiate human lung organoids (HLO). The organization of HLOs is similar to the native lung, e.g. these organoids contain upper airway-like epithelium with basal cells, immature ciliated cells, smooth muscle, myofibroblasts as well as alveolar-like cell types. Thus, HLOs offer an excellent model to study human lung diseases like COVID-19. Moreover, the iPS derived organoids overcome several of the limitations of currently used biopsy lung derived models (availability of alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2), inter biopsy variance).Within this proposal we aim to elaborate basics for the establishment of a high-throughput approach (differentiate HLOs with low variance). HLOs will be characterized using cryo-sectioning and immunofluorescence analysis upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to study viral replication kinetics and host responses. We recently contributed to the establishment of the first reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV-2 offering the flexibility of using reporter viruses for a screening approach. Finally, we will test our system upon treatment with established antiviral compounds and aim to set up screening approaches to test antiviral compound libraries. Our approach offers a state-of-the-art model to study SARS-CoV-2 derived pathology and paves the way for the identification of effective antiviral drugs at high throughput level.""; Research Type: discovery; Study population: not applicable","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-88,NA,NA,-99,NA,-88,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.5570.7","Ruhr Universit?t Bochum","Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"4","4b","6","6a",2

Our results will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of cellular adaptive immune responses against the still largely unknown SARS-CoV-2 virus, which could form a basis for diagnosis and future therapy of this infection.""; Research Type: discovery; Study population: T-cell analysis for healthy individuals, patients infected with COVID-19 and recovered individuals after COVID-19 infection","",-77,1,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,NA,424421007,NA,-88,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.14095.39","Freie Universit?t Berlin","Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"1","1a, 1d","","",2

This study will explore the major risk perceptions and behavioral intentions of different target groups. Communication methods and formats will be designed that promise to foster adequate behavior thus leading to risk reduction. The chain from risk perception, awareness, willingness to act up to behavioral change will inform the analysis. The risk perception paradox describing the gap between risk perception and protective action, can be addressed by identifying the opportunities of and barriers to risk adaptive behavior and enabling target-specific and inclusive risk communication. A long-term COVID-19- risk communication program will be established that is still effective when the peak of the crisis has been passed but protective action is still needed.The project will use survey methods in conjunction with focus groups and consensus methods (e.g. Group Delphi). This study will aim at providing a long-term risk communication manual, based on empirical and risk communication experience and a consensus among communication experts. Effective communication will reduce risks to health and live and can contribute to a better health record.; Research Type: social sciences; Study population: individuals of two age groups, 18-30 years of age and 50-70 years of age","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-88,-88,-99,-88,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.248501.a","DIALOGIK gemeinnÅtzige Gesellschaft fÅr Kommunikations- und Kooperationsforschung mbH, Stuttgart","Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Germany","276",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"9","9c","","",2

In addition to the acute consequences for the quality of care, long-term consequences for patients and care providers are to be expected because of the COVID-19 crisis. To learn more about the current situation, as well as the expected and actual long-term consequences, general practitioners and specialists will be surveyed throughout Germany as part of the study. For this purpose, a random selection of general practitioners (n = 5,000), internists (n = 3,000), ENT specialists (n = 2,000), pediatricians (n = 3,000), gynecologists (n = 2,000), and dentists (n = 4,000) will be surveyed anonymously using an online questionnaire. At the same time, the questionnaire offers the possibility to give extensive free text answers, which are analyzed qualitatively to form the basis of the next surveys. The online surveys will be conducted as trend analyses (3 cross-sectional analyses) after 2, 5, and 13 months. Differences according to urban??????rural areas (degree of spatial aggregation), age and gender, medical specialization, and organizational form of the practice (community health center (MVZ), shared practice, or group practice) will be analyzed, and statistical group comparisons will be carried out.

Recent estimates predict the deaths of 15 million people worldwide and that SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to result in an economic loss ????2.1 trillion GDP. Effective monitoring of this pathogen is vital to estimate the amount of infection circulating in the human population, and to inform the design of measures for controlling the spread of disease. The number of hospitalization cases from SARS-CoV-2 related diseases (COVID-19) provides some measure of disease prevalence in the population, it provides no reliable information on mild infections and asymptomatic carriers. The use of random 'spot checks' and thermal imaging cameras have been introduced to screen for infections, though these are costly to implement and very imprecise. Consequently, better methods are needed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the wider population. As SARS-CoV-2 is shed in faeces in high amounts (Xiao et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020), we hypothesize that wastewater can provide a powerful indicator of disease incidence at any point in time (Ye et al., 2016), particularly as most UK urban centres are served by only 1 or 2 wastewater treatment works, thereby providing a single integrated signal of millions of people in a single sample. The aim of this NERC Urgency project is therefore to:  (1) use wastewater to provide near real-time information on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 within the UK population;  (2) monitor the rise and subsequent decline of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK population, and to compare this to conventional disease reporting metrics (e.g. confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization cases);  (3) identify similarities in the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in the major urban centres of the UK;  (4) demonstrate the use of wastewater for the integrated surveillance of human pathogenic viruses within the human population;  (5) provide stakeholders (e.g. national government, NHS, HPA, PHE, PHW, HPS, water companies etc) with critical scientific information and tools to be able to respond and adapt to current and potential future disease epidemics.","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,-99,NA,1,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"grid.7362.0","Bangor University","United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"United Kingdom","826",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0

Prevalence of COVID-19 in young children hospitalized with severe pneumonia or severe acute malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia.",132160,"Although data from China, Europe and US show that children are less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than adults,we do not know what happens when the infection occurs in immunocompromised children. Malnutrition is common in low and moderate income countries and can be associated with other frequent co-morbidities like HIV infection and sickle cell disease. Severe pneumonia remains one of the main cause of death in young children living in these countries and is also the main clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 disease in children. The TB-Speed project offers a unique opportunity to identify sub-groups of children who may be particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and to propose specific measures to reduce the impact of the SARS-Cov-2 infection in these groups of children.  TB-Speed COVID is an ancillary study nested in two ongoing TB-Speed studies in 6 countries in Africa and Asia: the TB-Speed Pneumonia trial that evaluates the impact of systematic detection of tuberculosis on mortality among young children admitted with severe pneumonia, and the TB-Speed SAM study that is aiming to develop a tuberculosis diagnostic algorithm for hospitalized children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). The TB-Speed COVID study will assess the prevalence of the COVID-19 in these two groups of children at admission and its impact on children????????s outcomes. The 1st study group will be children below 5 years old with diagnosis of severe pneumonia according to WHO, and the 2nd group will be children younger than 5 years old, hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition defined by either weight-for-height Z score < -3 standard deviation or mid-upper arm circumference < 115 mm or clinical signs of bilateral pitting oedema. After informed consent signed by parents or guardian, nasal swab and stool will be collected and sent to referral testing laboratories for real time PCR of SARS-Cov-2. Dried blood spot will be collected at enrolment and after 3 months in infected children to assess seroprevalence and seroconversion. Clinical, biological and chest-ray data will be extracted from the TB-Speed Pneumonia and SAM studies at enrolment and during follow-up.  Consecutive children included in the 15 sites of the TB-Speed Pneumonia study across 6 countries (Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote d????????Ivoire, Mozambique, Uganda, Zambia) and in the 3 sites of the TB-Speed SAM in Uganda and Zambia will be enrolled in the TB-Speed COVID study over a 6 months period.

On July 23, 2020, more than 114 000 cases and 1782 deaths have been reported in West Africa. C????te d'Ivoire and Senegal are among the most affected countries with 15 000 cases in C????te d??????Ivoire and 9300 cases in Senegal. In order to control the epidemic, it is necessary to intervene at all levels of medical management, including primary care and working with healthcare workers who are among the most important actors in the epidemic response. However, primary care practitioners often practice in isolated settings without easy access to national recommendations, where and when they exist. It has been shown that electronic tools can help practitioners in their diagnostic and therapeutic decisions when caring for patients. However, according to the WHO, the distribution of electronic or digital health tools is still very limited in Africa. The overarching goal of this project is to improve the clinical management of COVID-19 patients in West Africa. For this, we propose to create, and make available, a free and independent electronic clinical decision support (CDSS) for the management of patients suspected or confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection: Antibioclic Afrique. Antibioclic Afrique would enable primary care clinicians to obtain personalized recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic management in a few ""clicks"" adapted to each clinical situation. It would also advise them on the prevention aspects (organization of the health facility), and on the advice to give to patients. Several stages are essential for the sustainable success of this project: (i) developing an electronic tool to guide the clinical management of patients based on the architecture of Antibioclic which uses a systematic method to translate clinical recommendations into semi-formal decision trees (ii) adapting and tailoring it to the West African context in 5 different countries, taking into account the local context, the organization of the healthcare system and the diversity of health care facilities and training of prescribers (iii) implementing the CDSS guided by  the use of theoretical frameworks and systematic strategies in implementation science in order to optimize the chances of success (iv) widely disseminating the tool by relying on the networks of the project investigators, of the ANRS, the African Society of Infectious Pathology (SAPI) and REACTing (v) monitoring and updating Antibioclic Afrique to provide decision support adapted to the current recommendations. This project will be associated with a research project which will aim to evaluate the implementation process, using methods drawn from implementation science. Implementation science is defined as ""the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic adoption of research results and other evidence-based practices in routine practice and, thereby, to improve the quality and 'care efficiency'. These methods are based on an assessment of the local context, the definition of interventions adapted to this context, and the evaluation of the implementation process. This methodology will aim to optimize the decision support tool by its adaptation, its usefulness, its efficiency, and its cost (development and implementation costs, the tool being free), and especially its sustainable use by primary care clinicians in West Africa. The scientific information gathered during this project will feed knowledge on the implementation of electronic decision support tools (i) in primary care (ii) in West Africa and (iii) in a pandemic context.","",-77,-77,2020,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,-88,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Burkina Faso, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Senegal","854, 266, 384, 466, 686",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"4","4c","","",0

Current situation: The COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly progressing in sub-Saharan Africa where SCD is a major public health problem (defined by WHO as a health priority). As of 04/13/2020, Mali has deplored 105 cases of confirmed COVID infection and 9 deaths, these figures are probably highly underestimated due to undiagnosed cases. A massive epidemic wave is expected, to which the health system will not be able to cope adequately. Three centers have been designated for the management of COVID+ patients. On the other hand, the CRLD in Bamako is following a cohort of 12,000 SCD patients.  Specific issues: Viral infections in SCD patients, particularly with pulmonary tropism, are known to trigger severe complications (vaso-occlusive crisis and/or life-threatening acute thoracic syndrome). Therefore, these patients may be considered as more fragile or at least to constitute a distinctive population in the context of a COVID infection. Thus, it is an urgency for the CRLD to establish a suitable procedure for the early identification and specific management of its COVID+ patients. At the same time, the medical teams at COVID centers are not trained to the specificities of the SCD patients???????? management. SCD patients present with a chronic baseline inflammation, that worsens during acute complications. It is not known whether this characteristic represents a detrimental factor during COVID infection. The implementation of dedicated strategies by highly competent multidisciplinary teams and the definition of the specificities of COVID infection in SCD patients are a priority.  Methods: Collaborative research/action project between the CRLD and the 3 COVID Centers in Bamako, and in Paris: the Internal Medicine Dept. of the European Georges Pompidou Hospital, one of the French SCD Reference Centers and equipped with a dedicated COVID sector, and the UMR 1134 Inserm/University of Paris/National Institute of Blood Transfusion (INTS). Project composed of three components: 1) organizational: training of the CRLD medical staff (doctors, nurses, biologists, laboratory technicians) to identify SCD patients at the various stages of COVID infection and, conversely, training the staff of the COVID Centers in the specific aspects of patients???????? management, 2) clinical research: recruitment of 3 groups, matched in age +/- 5 years: 200 SCD patients admitted to CRLD emergency ward identified as suspect of COVID infection and therefore isolated in a dedicated sector (100 PCR COVID+ patients and 100 PCR COVID-), 100 non-SCD patients PCR COVID +, hospitalized at the COVID Center of the Mali Hospital, 3) translational research: characterization of the inflammatory parameters in COVID+ SCD patients in comparison to the control groups (non-infected SCD patients and non-SCD COVID+ patients ) by measuring cytokines in frozen plasmas air-shipped in dry ice to the INTS in Paris.  Work schedule: July 2020 (M8): ethics committee, construction of the database, M9-M11: recruitments, standard clinical and biological monitoring, implementation of the database, creation of the plasma library; M12: measurement of plasma cytokines, analysis and exploitation of the results.  Expected results: 1) Control the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic and reduce mortality in the particularly fragile population of SCD patients in Mali, 2) Demonstration of the epidemiological and clinical features linked to COVID-19 infection of SCD patients in the African context, 3) Define the inflammatory profiles of the 3 groups studied in Africa where the population is permanently exposed to high infectious pressure.","",-77,-77,2021,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Sickle cell disease patients",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,43489008,NA,NA,-99,1,NA,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Mali","466",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"4","4a, 4b","","",2

SARS-CoV-2-like strains have so far been isolated in two Asian mammals, a bat and a pangolin. Given the diversity of SARS-CoV viruses and their acknowledged ability to jump the species barrier, it is reasonable to consider that most of the SARS-CoV-2-like diversity spectrum remains to be described. Such knowledge gap could explain the current incapacity to describe the transmission pathway that allowed the infection of humans, the most privileged scenario being that of multiple recombinations among SARS-CoV-2-like strains in (unknown) intermediary hosts. Because the unsustainable harvesting of wildlife has a direct impact on the propagation of emerging diseases, wildlife trade surveys constitute crucial sentinels for the surveillance of future SARSCoV- 2-related outbreaks. Bushmeat (wild game) consumption is a major cultural practice in tropical Africa and has been the source of deadly zoonotic diseases such as HIV, Ebola and Lassa fever. Although SARS-CoV- 2-like viruses are yet unknown in tropical Africa, we posit that available evidence supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2-like virus diversity has remained largely unscreened in mammals and that a huge knowledge gap in tropical Africa remains to be filled. All the more since the only mammals so far screened positive to SARS-CoV-2-like in Asia also have representatives in tropical Africa (pangolin and horseshoe bat).  Because in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic surveying reservoirs and wildlife trade practices is a prerequisite to efficient health surveillance, AFRICoV tackles the issue of SARSCoV- 2 infection from the original prism of the reservoirs as part of the wildlife (bushmeat) trade established in Africa ???????? and recently linking the African continent to Asia (through pangolin trafficking). Our general objective is to conduct health surveillance and risk assessment for a potential next SARS-CoV-2-related pandemic in tropical Africa linked to bushmeat consumption and trade. This is especially relevant in the African context given the general lack of awareness of populations regarding health issues linked to bushmeat consumption. AFRICoV aims to understand the pathways of infection between animals to humans through four main objectives:  (i) assessing the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in mammals from tropical Africa,  Specific objectives:  - Systematic screening of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the widest possible spectrum of African mammals sold in the bushmeat market  - Intensive screening of the African counterparts of the known Asian hosts (pangolins and horseshoe bats)  (ii) characterizing the evolution of SARS-CoV-2,  Specific objectives:  - Genome assembly of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses  - Phylogenomic analysis and datation among SARS-CoV-2-like strains  - Characterization of evolutionary rates and recombination events  (iii) anticipating a new SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in sub-Saharan Africa,  Specific objectives:  - Patterns of species-to-species infection during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses (among wild  mammals) and in the recent time (SARS-CoV-2; from humans to domestic / captive animals) - Detection of putative recombination in the recent time (between humans and domestic / captive animals)  (iv) implementing efficient measures protecting African people from new zoonotic diseases.  Through AFRICoV, we propose a multi-disciplinary approach linking genomic characterization of new SARS-CoV-2-like viruses, health surveillance of mammalian reservoirs and the study of bushmeat stakeholders???????? perceptions on the COVID-19 pandemic and its link with wildlife consumption, through an unprecedented comparative approach among three countries (Cote d????????Ivoire, Benin and Cameroon). Members of the AFRICoV project have a demonstrated, longterm expertise in wildlife trade surveys, involving genetic / genomic surveys of mammalian hosts and their pathogens and the study of bushmeat stakeholders???????? representations and awareness on zoonoses linked to the wildlife trade. Such long-term upstream work provides an exceptional opportunity to access the bushmeat market network in Africa and assess the health risks associated to SARS-CoV-2-like viruses and bushmeat consumption.  The main outputs from AFRICoV will include a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2-like virus evolution in mammals, an unprecedented estimation of SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in Africa, the validation of an RT-PCR assay for screening SARS-CoV-2(-like) viruses in mammalian reservoirs, South-to-South training in the rapid diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2(-like) viruses (RT-PCR), educative material associated to bushmeat consumption and public health (leaflet and diffusion to national Medias), and a regional restitution workshop in western Africa including policy makers.","",-77,-77,2021,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-99,-99,-99,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Benin","384, 120, 204",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1, 2","1b, 2a","12","12b, 12c",1

Recent data reveals that the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection can vary greatly among individuals, from asymptomatic to mild symptoms, severe symptoms or critical conditions. The reasons underlying this variation in the clinical outcome remain unknown. There are two main ways a host deals with infection. One is through resistance, the ability to restrict or eliminate the infectious agent. This function is primarily performed by the immune system. The second, disease tolerance, is the capacity of the host to avoid or restrict the pathological consequences of an infection. The rate of contamination by virus spreading to highly exposed healthcare professionals has been dramatic. Through longitudinal multi-parametric and pathophysiological analysis, the study will provide directly in human, the proof of the concept that disease tolerance allows for homeostatic protection against an ongoing viral infection in such emerging pandemic infection. We speculate from past experience and know-how on mucosal regulatory pathways maintaining protection and homeostasis against viral infections, that IgA and Treg/Th17 division of labor is essential both for controlling virus and at the same time ensuring a safe host responsiveness, with minimal collateral damage, from onset to end of infection and resolution of disease. The clinical follow up of the individuals, from early onset mild clinical symptoms to more severe pathological signs (respiratory failure, morbidity, mortality), will allow to retrospectively identify severity and risk individuals associated to failure of disease tolerance mechanisms. This knowledge should help to better control COVID-19 pandemia and would provide a scientific basis, un-valuable for identifying individuals that should benefit from therapeutic intervention and/or vaccination strategies.","",-77,-77,2021,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Brazil","76",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"4","4a, 4b","","",2

The circulation of SARS-CoV2 in Rhinolophus bats around the world and especially near China as in Bangladesh is not known. In this country where the highly lethal Nipah virus already emerges from other bats every year, the circulation of SARS-COV2 could represent a major risk of new emergence. Thus, deciphering the mechanisms of the antiviral response that allow the natural host not to develop symptoms is an unavoidable challenge today. Here we propose to assess the prevalence and the risk of emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh and to develop Rhinolophus sp based cellular tools which will be essential for studying the virus-natural host interactions.

Therapeutics and development prophylactic vaccine are urgently and desperately needed.  The aim of this project is to decipher the benefice of antibodies (Ab) directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of COVID-19 as therapeutic or in vaccine strategies. This domain that directly interact with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was previously proposed to be a relevant therapeutic and vaccine immunogen. Monoclonal Abs directed against the RDB of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, responsible for the 2012 epidemic in Middle East, have shown interesting cross-neutralizing activities. However, these mAbs have only mild cross reactivity with the new coronavirus emerged in 2019, further suggesting that COVID-19 RBD display particular features. Moreover, as some potentially deleterious enhancing effects were described in vitro for certain RDB MERS-Cov specific antibodies, in depth characterization of the functional profile of the newly generated mAb is required.  A strong collaboration between C. Moog????????s lab (U1109 INSERM) and F. Shokri????????s lab (Tehran University of Medical Sciences) will be developed to perform an in depth characterization of the functional activities of the Abs generated. As a second step, the potential efficacy of the most promizing mAbs generated will be tested in vivo using intranasally COVID-19 infected BALB/c mice transgenic for human ACE2 and CD147.  The identification of RBD specific mAbs displaying functional cross-inhibitory activity against COVID-19 without deleterious toxic or enhancing effects will give clues for the use of such type of Abs for therapeutic intervention and will guide us for the development of vaccine immunogens.","",-77,1,2020,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"antibodies ( monoclonal antibody)",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43489008,-88,NA,-99,-88,-88,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Iran, France","364, 250",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1","1d","","",2

The actual COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS-CoV2 virus clearly illustrates the global damage of a single cross-species transmission from an animal coronavirus leading to a lock down of 4 billion people across the globe in a few months only. Bats have been confirmed to be the origin of human CoVs, either directly or by an intermediate host. Contacts between humans and bats are diverse, and range from direct exposure to infected blood or tissues through hunting and butchering, or indirect exposure to bat guano or fruit contaminated by their saliva, urine or faeces. A wide diversity of bat species are hunted for food or medicine, and bushmeat hunting is increasingly recognized inWest and Central Africa. Therefore, documenting the prevalence and genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats is now more than crucial. The general objective of the project is to provide new on coronaviruses in bats in African countries with high likelihood for emergence of zoonotic infections from bats. Overall we will (i) document the genetic diversity and evolution of coronaviruses in African bats; (ii) develop a high throughput serological assay to study antibodies to different coronaviruses and estimate prevalence of coronaviruses in different bat species and (iii) study seasonality of coronavirus shedding in bats.  From previous studies in Guinea, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zimbabwe, we have already samples from >10,000 bats in their natural habitat available (Dried blood spots, oral and anal swabs, and fecal samples). Retrospective screening for presence of coronaviruses will be done by amplifying and sequencing of a 440bp fragment of RdRp. On a subset of samples, additional sequence efforts will be done to obtain sequences from larger genomic fragments (especially in genes that are important for serological assays (S and/or N genes) or near full-length genomes using MinION technology. We will use a high throughput serological assay (Luminex approach) to detect antibodies to coronaviruses (SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2, MERSV, ..) to screen bat samples in which no viral RNA could be amplified for the presence of antibodies. Like other pathogens, it is possible that coronaviruses also exhibit highly seasonal circulation patterns and occasional sampling may not be sufficient for detecting coronavirus RNA or antibodies. Samples from bat colonies in Cameroon and Guinea, collected during monthly follow-up over a one year period will be analyzed for presence of viral RNA in shedding and for antibodies to document seasonality of viral shedding in different species.  Overall, this study will rapidly provide key informations on the genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats in Africa and estimates on their prevalence. This is the first study to look for coronavirus infection rates at a large scale in bats across Africa and using the same technologies for molecular and serological screening allowing thus comparison of results between geographic areas and species. The study will provide information on proportions of bats that are shedding virus, have been infected with the virus and on seasons when viral shedding is highest for zoonotic transmissions. The information obtained by this project will also contribute to development of an appropriate diagnostic platform that can include a large panel of broadly reactive and specific antigens covering as much as possible the diversity of coronaviruses to rapidly identify circulation of new coronaviruses in humans as well as development of broad-spectrum vaccines. Similarly, additional information on targets of antiviral drugs for a wide diversity of coronaviruses with zoonotic potential will be useful to identify eventual activity of existing and new drugs.","",-77,-77,2020,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,-9999,NA,-9999,NA,1,NA,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Guinea, Cameroon, Congo, Zimbabwe","324, 120, 178, 716",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1, 2","1c, 1d, 2a","","",2

Its spread is such that it has since been declared pandemic and represents a public health emergency. Europe quickly became heavily impacted by the virus, now joined by America, areas where political and health authorities are trying with great difficulties to contain the epidemic that seriously affects elderly or co-morbid people.  The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect many sensitive regions with fragile health care systems, such as Africa. Indeed, 2230 cases have already been confirmed in Mali so far, affecting every region. Bamako is the most impacted city. Caregivers, in the front line of Covid19 patient management, may accidentally become infected and a source of infection during the incubation phase or in case of asymptomatic infection.  The objectives of this project are thus i) to limit SARS-Cov-2 spread over the hospital departments of Bamako by carrying out a systematic molecular screening of symptomatic persons (patients/caregivers) or confirmed cases contacts and by highlighting transmission clusters, and ii) to evaluate the feasibility of Point-Of-Care molecular assays in Mali. In addition, iii) viral spread and immunity acquired from SARS-Cov-2 among health workers through serological testing, allowing also the assessment of asymptomatic caregivers rate and absence of re-infection among the immunized caregivers. Finally, iv) variability of the virus over time and spread of different variants around the world will be studied by sequencing the viral genome.  The data obtained during this collaborative work will better characterize the COVID19 infection in Bamako and will give the opportunity to struggle against in real time, while it seems essential to limit as much as possible the spread of the virus in developing countries. Our project also aims to improve our virological knowledge about this emerging virus.","",-77,-77,2021,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Mali","466",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0

The current data presents a critical and alarming situation in Asia and Europe. The dramatic evolution of this pandemic in the regions of the world best prepared for such a situation makes the African continent fear an uncertain prospect. The African continent currently presents extremely fragmented data, which does not allow defining the state of the epidemic on the continent. Without this information, it is and will be difficult, if not impossible, to develop appropriate strategies and responses to prevent, contain and eliminate the pandemic on the continent.  The main objective of this study is to contribute to the development of new surveillance strategies, more suited to the context of the resource-limited settings as Sub-Saharan Africa and to model the state and progression of the epidemic in the region using these data. Data on the proportion of circulating specific antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in the communities will be of particular importance. We are articulating our research in particular on the performance, the contribution and the role of rapid diagnostic tests in the diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The study will be conducted in Central Africa, in two countries, Gabon and the Republic of Congo. These two countries are facing a rising epidemic like many other countries in the region and can serve as research sites for the definition of strategies that can be applied to other countries in the region. This research will allow us to fill an important gap in the current strategy for understanding and responding to the COVID-19 epidemic.","",-77,-77,2021,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,-9999,85944001,-88,1,-88,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,"","",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Congo, Gabon","178, 266",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3","3a","","",2

We exploit a baseline survey conducted among 800 households in three cities of the Southern Central region three months before the CoViD-19 epidemic to understand how the risk of contracting the disease is affected by an individual's access to information on preventive actions, by the household's budget constraint and by exposure to air pollution (PM2.5). To shed light on this relationship, we will conduct a randomized experiment in which an information treatment aimed at addressing informational market failures will be cross-randomized with unconditional cash transfers designed to incentivize households to adopt preventive actions (regular handwashing, wearing face masks, etc). All sampled households will be re-interviewed pre and post intervention to document disease related learning processes as well as changes in preventive behaviors. Serological tests will be conducted in all adult individuals belonging to the sample after the intervention. Data on individual exposure to particulate matters collected for 550 individuals during the baseline survey at the end of 2019 will be leveraged to explore the relationship between air pollution and the incidence of severe cases of CoVid-19. The panel dataset which will be available at the end of the study will significantly contribute to improving our understanding of the reach of the CoViD-19 epidemic in Burkina Faso and will inform public health and environmental policies aimed at containing future outbreaks of coronavirus.","",-77,-77,2021,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28335002,NA,-99,-99,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,"","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Burkina Faso","854",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"10","10b","","",0
