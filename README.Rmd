The [Pandemic PACT](https://www.pandemicpact.org/) monitors and analyses global funding and research evidence related to diseases with pandemic potential, as well as broader research preparedness efforts, and is equipped to pivot in response to outbreaks. It collects, curates, codes, and analyses data in alignment with WHO priority diseases and other selected illnesses, including pandemic influenza, mpox, and plague. Pandemic PACT aims to guide policy and decision-making for research funders, policymakers, researchers, multilateral agencies. The Pandemic PACT data is publicly available for download from its [website](https://www.pandemicpact.org/) and from [Figshare](https://portal.sds.ox.ac.uk/pandemicpact). This package provides an application programming interface (API) to the research programme's [Figshare](https://portal.sds.ox.ac.uk/pandemicpact) repository to provide programmatic access to its publicly available tracker data along with it's other data products.

## What does `{pactr}` do?

`{pactr}` provides functions to interface with Pandemic PACT's [Figshare](https://portal.sds.ox.ac.uk/pandemicpact) repository for programmatic access to its contents. These functions are wrappers to specific functions of the [`{deposits}` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/deposits/index.html) which provides the underlying universal interface to various online research data deposition services including Figshare. Current Figshare-specific functionalities available in `{pactr}` are:

1. Listing of outputs/assets available from the Panedmic PACT Figshare repository;

2. Download of outputs/assets available from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository;

3. Reading of dataset outputs/assets available from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository; and,

4. Processing of Pandemic PACT data.

## Installation

`{pactr}` is not yet on CRAN but can be installed through the [Oxford IHTM r-universe](https://oxfordihtm.r-universe.dev) with:

```R
install.packages(
  "pactr",
  repos = c("https://oxfordihtm.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

Alternatively, `{pactr}` can be installed directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/OxfordIHTM/pactr) using the `{remotes}` package with the following command:

```R
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("OxfordIHTM/pactr")
```

`pactr` can then be loaded for use with:

```{r load-package}
library(pactr)
```

## Usage

### Set a Figshare client

Usage of `{pactr}` always starts with the setting up of a Figshare client. This requires creating a Figshare account and then creating a personal access token [here](https://figshare.com/account/applications).

Once a figshare token is created, it needs to be stored as a local environment vqariable. This can be done using the following command in R:

```R
Sys.setenv("FIGSHARE_TOKEN"="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
```

Once this token has been set as described above, the following command can be run to setup a Figshare client:

```{r setup-client}
pact_client <- pact_client_set()
```

Once a Figshare client has been setup, you can now perform the functionalities provided by the `{pactr}` package.

### List outputs/assets

To list available outputs/assets from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository, issue the following command:

```{r usage-1a, eval = FALSE}
pact_list(pact_client)
```

The output is a `data.frame` containing metadata regarding contents of the Figshare Pandemic PACT group. The information within the metadata are those provided by [Figshare's application programming interface (API)](https://docs.figshare.com/) and are either set by the Pandemic PACT data team or by Figshare. The data.frame would have the following fields:

```{r usage-1b, echo = FALSE}
pact_list(pact_client) |>
  names()
```

This function is useful in getting an overview of what is currently available in the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository.

### Download outputs/assets

To download a specific output/asset - say the scoping review data - from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository, issue the following commands:

```{r usage-2a, eval = FALSE}
## Get the unique identifier for the scoping review data from Figshare ----
file_id <- pact_list(pact_client) |>
  subset(title == "Scoping Review Data", select = id) |>
  unlist()

pact_download(id = file_id, path = ".")
```

This will download the file `Scoping_Review-Data.xlsx` from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository into the current working directory.

### Read the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset and data dictionary

To read the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset into R, issue the following command:

```{r usage-3a, eval = FALSE}
pact_read_data_tracker(pact_client)
```

which outputs a data.frame with 4637 records and 860 fields. 

```{r usage-3b, echo = FALSE}
pact_read_data_tracker(pact_client) |>
  str()
```

This function reads the *labelled* tracker dataset by default. If the raw dataset is required, then issue the following command:

```{r usage-3c, eval = FALSE}
pact_read_data_tracker(pact_client, tracker_type = "raw")
```

which outputs a data.frame with 4638 records and 860 fields.

```{r usage-3d, echo = FALSE}
pact_read_data_tracker(pact_client, tracker_type = "raw") |>
  str()
```

### Process the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset

```{r useage-3e}
pact_read_data_tracker(pact_client) |>
  pact_process_data_tracker()
```

## Citation

To cite the `{pactr}` package, please use the suggested citation provided by a call to the `citation()` function as follows:

```{r citation-package}
citation("pactr")
```

To cite the Pandemic PACT Tracker dataset, please use the suggested citation provided by a call to the `pact_cite()` function as follows:

```{r citation-data}
pact_cite(pact_client, id = 24763548)  ## cite the labelled version of the tracker dataset
```
