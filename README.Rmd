The [Pandemic PACT](https://www.pandemicpact.org/) monitors and analyses global funding and research evidence related to diseases with pandemic potential, as well as broader research preparedness efforts, and is equipped to pivot in response to outbreaks. It collects, curates, codes, and analyses data in alignment with WHO priority diseases and other selected illnesses, including pandemic influenza, mpox, and plague. Pandemic PACT aims to guide policy and decision-making for research funders, policymakers, researchers, multilateral agencies. The Pandemic PACT data is publicly available for download from its [website](https://www.pandemicpact.org/) and from [Figshare](https://portal.sds.ox.ac.uk/pandemicpact). This package provides an application programming interface (API) to both the research programme's Figshare repository and website data download facility to provide programmatic access to its publicly available tracker data along with its other data products.

## What does `{pactr}` do?

`{pactr}` provides functions to interface programmatically with Pandemic PACT's data products either through its Figshare repository or its website. 

The functions for Figshare interface are wrappers to specific functions of the [`{deposits}` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/deposits/index.html) which provides the underlying universal interface to various online research data deposition services including Figshare. Current Figshare-specific functionalities available in `{pactr}` are:

1. Listing of outputs/assets available from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository (*experimental*);

2. Downloading of outputs/assets available from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository (*experimental*);

3. Reading of dataset outputs/assets available from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository (*experimental*); and,

4. Processing of Pandemic PACT data (*experimental*).

The functions for interfacing with the data available from the Pandemic PACT website allow for downloading, reading, and processing. Current website data-specific functionalities available in `{pactr}` are:

1. Downloading of Pandemic PACT dataset available from the website (*stable*);

2. Reading of Pandemic PACT dataset available from the website (*stable*); and,

3. Processing of Pandemic PACT dataset available from the website (*experimental*).

## Motivation

The main motivation for the development of `{pactr}` is to create a standardised programmatic interface to Pandemic PACT's data for those performing research or investigation relevant to Pandemic PACT's objectives. Standardised programmatic interface, in turn, allow for reproducible scientific workflows based on the Pandemic PACT dataset.

## Installation

`{pactr}` is not yet on CRAN but can be installed through the [Oxford IHTM r-universe](https://oxfordihtm.r-universe.dev) with:

```R
install.packages(
  "pactr",
  repos = c("https://oxfordihtm.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

Alternatively, `{pactr}` can be installed directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/OxfordIHTM/pactr) using the `{remotes}` package with the following command:

```R
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("OxfordIHTM/pactr")
```

`{pactr}` can then be loaded for use with:

```{r load-package}
library(pactr)
```

## Usage - Figshare workflow

### Set a Figshare client

Usage of `{pactr}` always starts with the setting up of a Figshare client. This requires creating a Figshare account and then creating a personal access token [here](https://figshare.com/account/applications).

Once a Figshare token is created, it needs to be stored as a local environment variable. This can be done using the following command in R:

```R
Sys.setenv("FIGSHARE_TOKEN"="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
```

Once this token has been set as described above, the following command can be run to setup a Figshare client:

```{r setup-client}
pact_client <- pact_client_set()
```

Once a Figshare client has been setup, you can now perform the functionalities provided by the `{pactr}` package.

### List outputs/assets

To list available outputs/assets from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository, issue the following command:

```{r usage-1a, eval = FALSE}
pact_list(pact_client)
```

The output is a `data.frame` containing metadata regarding contents of the Figshare Pandemic PACT group. The information within the metadata are those provided by [Figshare's application programming interface (API)](https://docs.figshare.com/) and are either set by the Pandemic PACT data team or by Figshare. The data.frame would look as follows:

```{r usage-1b, echo = FALSE}
pact_list(pact_client) |>
  tibble::tibble()
```

This function is useful in getting an overview of what is currently available in the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository.

### Download outputs/assets

To download a specific output/asset - say the scoping review data - from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository, issue the following commands:

```{r usage-2a, eval = FALSE}
## Get the unique identifier for the scoping review data from Figshare ----
file_id <- pact_list(pact_client) |>
  subset(title == "Scoping Review Data", select = id) |>
  unlist()

pact_download_figshare(id = file_id, path = ".")
```

This will download the file `Scoping_Review-Data.xlsx` from the Pandemic PACT Figshare repository into the current working directory.

### Read the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset and data dictionary

To read the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset into R, issue the following command:

```{r usage-3a, eval = FALSE}
pact_read_figshare(pact_client)
```

which outputs a data.frame with 4637 records and 860 fields. 

```{r usage-3b, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
figshare_data <- pact_read_figshare(pact_client) |>
  tibble::tibble()

figshare_data
```

This function reads the *labelled* tracker dataset by default. If the raw dataset is required, then issue the following command:

```{r usage-3c, eval = FALSE}
pact_read_figshare(pact_client, tracker_type = "raw")
```

which outputs a data.frame with 4638 records and 860 fields.

```{r usage-3d, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
figshare_data_raw <- pact_read_figshare(pact_client, tracker_type = "raw") |>
  tibble::tibble()

figshare_data_raw
```

### Process the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset

```{r usage-3e, eval = FALSE}
pact_read_figshare(pact_client) |>
  pact_process_figshare() |>
  tibble::tibble()
```

```{r useage-3f, echo = FALSE}
figshare_data |>
  pact_process_figshare() |>
  tibble::tibble()
```

For a more detailed discussion of the usage and limitations of the `{pactr}` Figshare functions, see this [vignette](https://oxford-ihtm.io/pactr/articles/figshare-workflow.html).

## Usage - website data workflow

### Download the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset from the website

To download the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset available from its website, the following command can be used:

```{r usage-website-1a, eval = FALSE}
## Save the dataset from website to a temporary directory ----
pact_download_website(path = tempdir())
```

which will return the path to the downloaded dataset:

```{r usage-website-1b, echo = FALSE}
## Save the dataset from website to a temporary directory ----
pact_download_website(path = tempdir())
```

### Read the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset from the website

Instead of downloading, the Pandemic PACT dataset available from its website can be read into R directly as follows:

```{r usage-website-2a, eval = FALSE}
pact_read_website()
```

which results in the following:

```{r usage-website-2b, echo = FALSE}
pact_read_website()
```

### Process the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset from the website

The package includes functions that will process the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset into specific structures and aggregations that will allow for further plotting and reporting of similar outputs that are currently presented in the Pandemic PACT website.

For example, the following will process the Pandemic PACT tracker dataset into an aggregated dataset structure that can be used to create a similar plot to the one presented in the [website](https://www.pandemicimpact.org/visualise#disease).

```{r usage-website-3a, eval = FALSE}
pact_read_website() |>
  pact_process_website() |>
  pact_table_topic_group(topic = "Disease", group = "GrantStartYear")
```

which produces the following output:

```{r usage-website-3b, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
pact_data <- pact_read_website() |>
  pact_process_website()

tidy_df <- pact_data |>
  pact_table_topic_group(topic = "Disease", group = "GrantStartYear")

tidy_df
```

which in turn can be plotted as follows:

```{r usage-website-3c, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 8}
disease_df <- tidy_df |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    Disease = factor(
    x = Disease, 
      levels = c(
        "COVID-19", "Disease X", "Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever", 
        "Ebola virus disease", "Hendra virus infection", "Lassa fever", 
        "Marburg virus disease", 
        "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)", 
        "Mpox", "Nipah and henipaviral disease", "Pandemic-prone influenza",
        "Plague", "Rift Valley Fever", "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)", "Zika virus disease", "Congenital Zika virus disease", "Other", 
        "Unspecified", "Not applicable"
      ),
      labels = c(
        "COVID-19", "Disease X", "CCHF", "Ebola", "Hendra virus", "Lassa fever", 
        "Marburg", "MERS-CoV", "Mpox", "NiV and Henipa", "Pandemic influenza", 
        "Plague", "RVF", "SARS", "Zika", "Zika (congenital)", "Other", 
        "Unspecified", "Not applicable"
      )
    )
  )

ggplot2::ggplot(
  data = disease_df,
  mapping = ggplot2::aes(
    x = GrantStartYear, y = n_grants, group = Disease, color = Disease
  )
) +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Year of Award Start", y = "Number of Grants") +
  oxthema::theme_oxford() +
  ggplot2::theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 8),
    legend.spacing.y = ggplot2::unit(2, 'points'),
    panel.border = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_blank()
  )
```

or alternatively:

```{r usage-website-3d, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 12}
disease_df |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(
    mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = GrantStartYear, y = n_grants, group = Disease)
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(
    colour = oxthema::get_oxford_colour("sky"), 
    linewidth = 0.75, alpha = 0.7
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_pretty()) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(. ~ Disease, nrow = 5, ncol = 4, scales = "free_y") +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Year of Award Start", y = "Number of Grants") +
  ggplot2::theme_bw() +
  ggplot2::theme(
    strip.background = ggplot2::element_rect(
      fill = oxthema::get_oxford_colour("Oxford blue"), 
      colour = oxthema::get_oxford_colour("Oxford blue") 
    ),
    strip.text = ggplot2::element_text(colour = "#FFFFFF", size = 9),
    panel.border = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
    axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_blank()
  )
```
