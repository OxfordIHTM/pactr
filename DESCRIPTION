Description: The Pandemic PACT <https://www.pandemicpact.org/> monitors and 
    analyses global funding and research evidence related to diseases with 
    pandemic potential, as well as broader research preparedness efforts, and is 
    equipped to pivot in response to outbreaks. It collects, curates, codes, 
    and analyses data in alignment with WHO priority diseases and other selected 
    illnesses, including pandemic influenza, mpox, and plague. Pandemic PACT 
    aims to guide policy and decision-making for research funders, policymakers, 
    researchers, multilateral agencies. The database is publicly available for
    download from its website and from Figshare. This package interfaces with
    the project's Figshare repository to provide programmatic access to the
    database along with other data products provided by the project.
