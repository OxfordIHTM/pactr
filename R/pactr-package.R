#' An Interface to the Pandemic PACT Database
#'
#' The Pandemic PACT <https://www.pandemicpact.org/> monitors and analyses
#' global funding and research evidence related to diseases with pandemic
#' potential, as well as broader research preparedness efforts, and is equipped
#' to pivot in response to outbreaks. It collects, curates, codes, and analyses
#' data in alignment with WHO priority diseases and other selected illnesses,
#' including pandemic influenza, mpox, and plague. Pandemic PACT aims to guide
#' policy and decision-making for research funders, policymakers, researchers,
#' multilateral agencies. The database is publicly available for download from
#' its website and from Figshare. This package interfaces with the project's
#' Figshare repository to provide programmatic access to the database along with
#' other data products provided by the project.
